This is one of the first playable nodes and must function as a tutorial for combat, puzzles and larger node exploration. It's the tutorial dungeon of the first world. The layout needs to guide the player through a specific sequence of events from Chapter 1 of the story.

Mandatory Narrative Path: The room layout must follow this critical path in order:


Pre-Disaster Area: The first few rooms should be orderly mining corridors where the player faces a "temperamental mining drone" in a gentle combat tutorial. Include interactive 

[console] or [locker] keywords to teach basic exploration.


The Disaster: The path must lead to a central point where a "cave-in" or "reactor meltdown" occurs. This event should block the main path forward, forcing the player onto a chaotic, damaged detour route that feels improvised.


The Workshop: The detour must lead to a Workshop room. This room is essential as it contains the 

Tinkering Table where Nova crafts her energy slingshot, introducing the Tinkering system.

Elemental Combat Zone: After the workshop, create a path into an area like an "Irradiated Cavern" or "Collapsed Tunnel." This is where the player must fight a swarm of "irradiated cave critters" to learn the basics of elemental combat and status effects like Poison.

Escape Route: The node must conclude in a Supply Shuttle Bay or similar room. This is the location for the final cinematic where Nova's mentor helps her escape.

Layout and Design Specifics:

Contrast is Key: Design a clear visual and descriptive difference between the pre-disaster and post-disaster sections. The post-disaster area should feature descriptions of rubble, flickering lights, and leaking pipes.


Incorporate Puzzles: Include a simple environmental puzzle, like the "minecart track puzzle" mentioned in the design document, to clear debris or open a new path in the post-disaster section.

Side Rooms: While the main path is linear, add one or two optional, dead-end side rooms. These can contain extra scrap components for crafting, or a lore entry on a data pad, rewarding players who explore off the main path.


Atmosphere: The text descriptions for rooms should be eerie and tense after the disaster, with sounds of distant creature noises or groaning metal to build atmosphere.
