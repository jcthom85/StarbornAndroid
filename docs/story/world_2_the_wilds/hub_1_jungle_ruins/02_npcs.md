# NPCs — World 2: The Wilds

## Party Members (Recruitment Phase)

### Orion (The Ancient)
*   **Role:** The Guide / Healer.
*   **Location:** Stasis Chamber (MQ_08) -> The Astra.
*   **State of Mind:** **Grief-Stricken.** He went to sleep expecting to wake up to a rescue; he woke up to a dead civilization.
*   **Dialogue Style:** Formal, archaic, soft-spoken.
*   **Key Line:** "The music stopped. Why is the world so quiet?"
*   **Bark (Combat):** "I will not let another light fade!"

### Gh0st (The Hunter)
*   **Role:** The Antagonist (initially) -> The Protector.
*   **Location:** The Canopy (Ambush) -> Party.
*   **State of Mind:** **Haunted.** His HUD screams "KILL," but his core programming screams "PROTECT ELARA." He is paralyzed by the contradiction.
*   **Dialogue Style:** Clipped, military, robotic—until the mask cracks.
*   **Key Line:** "Target acquired. Target... locked? Unknown frequency. Why can't I pull the trigger?"
*   **Bark (Combat):** "Shields up. Stay behind me."

### Zeke (The Fish Out of Water)
*   **Location:** The Crash Site (Base).
*   **State of Mind:** **Useless.** He is an indoor creature. The jungle terrifies him.
*   **Dialogue:** Complaining to mask fear.
*   **Key Line:** "I can hack a bank mainframe in twelve seconds. I cannot, however, hack a mosquito. We are going to die here."

## Hostiles

### The Beast (Boss)
*   **Role:** Apex Predator / Source Beast.
*   **Appearance:** A silverback gorilla mutated by raw Source leakage. Glowing purple veins, bark-like armor.
*   **Behavior:** Territorially aggressive. It wants the Chime.
