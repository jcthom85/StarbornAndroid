# Events — World 2: The Wilds

## EVT_W2_01: The Hall of Echoes
*   **Trigger:** Entering the Sanctuary murals (MQ_07).
*   **Action:**
    *   The Sanctuary’s main hall is lined with stone panels that aren’t carved—they’re *tuned*. When Nova gets close, the engravings shimmer like a waveform finding a speaker.
    *   The murals depict tall, faceless figures—the Architects—standing in a circle.
    *   Between them: threads of light connecting skull to skull, heartbeat to heartbeat.
    *   The image shifts: the circle tightens until every thread becomes one knot.
    *   Zeke’s joke dies in his throat. "That’s… not a group chat."
    *   Orion stares at the panels like they’re a crime scene.
    *   **Orion:** "They called it Harmony. Not peace—control."
    *   **Orion:** "Dominion didn’t invent this. They’re rebuilding an old ladder."
    *   Nova touches the panel and hears it—not words, not a voice, just a chilling *instruction*: *merge / stabilize / silence.*

## EVT_W2_02: The Awakening
*   **Trigger:** MQ_08 (Reinitializing the Pod).
*   **Action:**
    *   Pod hisses open.
    *   Orion falls out, coughing blue fluid.
    *   Orion's eyes snap to the Chime.
    *   **Orion:** "That Chime... I jettisoned it. Twenty years ago."
    *   He takes it, slots it into the pod, and the lights stabilize.
    *   The moment the Chime clicks into place, Nova’s Echo marks flare—then the ruins drop out from under her.
    *   **Flashback (Source Imprint):**
        *   Clean lab lighting. Fresh steel bolted onto ancient stone. Dominion warning stripes over Architect geometry.
        *   Red strobes. A siren that sounds like it’s chewing through the air.
        *   A younger Orion slams a canister into a launch tube—hands shaking, eyes wild.
        *   **Lab PA:** "SOURCE BEAST CONTAINMENT BREACH."
        *   The far doors bow inward like something is leaning on them from the other side.
        *   Orion’s voice is a hiss meant for machines and prayers. "Get the signal out. If Veyra can hear me, it can find me."
        *   He hits the release. The Chime rockets away into darkness.
        *   For a single impossible beat, the darkness answers—not a roar, not a voice, but a soft chord like many notes agreeing to carry it.
        *   The room shakes. The air tastes like metal and static.
        *   Orion dives into the stasis pod. "Mute my signal. Now."
        *   The glass seals. A shadow lunges at the pod—geometry glitching, too big for the room.
    *   Nova gasps and the jungle ruins snap back into place.
    *   For a heartbeat, the pod’s hiss carries an undertone—soft harmony riding the static—then it’s gone.
    *   Zeke catches her elbow. "Hey—hey. You with us?"
    *   Orion stares at her like he’s seeing a witness.
    *   **Orion (hoarse):** "You saw it."
    *   **Orion:** "The signal stopped. Why did the music stop?"
    *   **Nova:** "What music?"
    *   **Orion:** "My people. They are silent."
    *   Orion studies Nova like he's afraid of the answer.
    *   Nova reaches out on instinct to Link—to steady his breathing—and the connection shrieks. Static tears across her vision.
    *   She staggers. Zeke catches her. Orion grabs her wrist, firm.
    *   **Orion:** "Not with the noise. Focus. Ground. Then we learn control."
    *   **Orion:** "You carry an Echo without erasing. Some humans have... traces. An old echo. We'll talk later."
    *   He looks at the ship console. "**The Bridge** (Relic) is intact. With this, we can fly."

## EVT_W2_02A: Canopy Ridge (Breather)
*   **Trigger:** Traveling toward the canopy (mid-MQ_09, mandatory beat).
*   **Action:**
    *   The jungle thins. The air cools. The crew climbs out onto a ridge of black stone.
    *   Suddenly: open sky.
    *   Below, the canopy rolls like an ocean. Far away, the Spire punches up through cloud cover, a needle of light and greed.
    *   And over everything—the Planetary Shield: a faint lattice curving across the horizon, rippling in timed pulses like a lock turning.
    *   **Zeke:** "Okay. I hate this. I hate how pretty this is."
    *   **Nova:** "Breathe, Zeke."
    *   **Zeke:** "I am breathing. I’m just doing it… angrily."
    *   Orion squints at the Shield like he’s listening more than looking.
    *   **Orion:** "It moves. Not randomly. Like a pattern."
    *   Nova sits, legs dangling over the drop. For the first time since the crash, she looks small—and allowed to be.
    *   **Nova:** "When we get out of this… remind me to find a place where the sky doesn't feel like a ceiling."
    *   The wind answers instead—thin and high, like a warning whistle through stone.
    *   A brief glint—scope flash—vanishes in the green.
    *   Nova’s Echo marks prickle. Not pain. *Attention.*
    *   Orion’s eyes narrow. "Someone is watching."
    *   Zeke’s humor evaporates. "Cool. Great. Love that for us."

## EVT_W2_03: The Glitch & The Beast
*   **Trigger:** MQ_09 (Confronting Gh0st).
*   **Action:**
    *   Gh0st drops from the canopy, blocking their path.
    *   **Cinematic Battle Sequence:**
        *   Gh0st raises his rifle at Nova. **HUD POV:** "TARGET ACQUIRED."
        *   He pulls the trigger. *Click.* Nothing happens.
        *   **HUD POV:** "ERROR. HARMONIC LOCK DETECTED."
        *   Gh0st growls and snaps his aim to Zeke.
        *   He pulls the trigger. *Click.*
        *   **HUD POV:** "ERROR. PROXIMITY OVERRIDE. HARMONIC LOCK EXTENDED."
        *   Gh0st, frustrated, spins and aims at Orion.
        *   He pulls the trigger. *Click.*
        *   **Gh0st:** "Weapon system failure? Impossible."
        *   He draws his blade and charges Nova—physical override.
        *   He swings, but his arm freezes mid-air, inches from her neck. His servos whine, fighting his own suit.
        *   Nova channels the Source. She doesn't just ping as Elara; she sings **Elara's Song**.
    *   Gh0st stumbles back, lowering his blade. "You sound like her. Why do you sound like her?"
    *   **Sudden Shift:** The trees behind Nova explode. The **Source Beast** (Mutated Silverback) lunges from the canopy, roaring.
    *   It swipes at Nova—a killing blow.
    *   **Gh0st:** "PROTECTION DIRECTIVE: ENGAGED."
    *   Gh0st shoulder-checks Nova out of the way, taking the hit on his armor. He slides back, shields flaring.
    *   **Gh0st:** "Target reassigned. We kill the beast."
    *   **[BOSS FIGHT: Source Beast]**
    *   **After the fight:** The Beast dissolves into Source dust. Gh0st stands over it, venting heat.
    *   **Gh0st:** "You are an anomaly. But you are not the enemy."
    *   **Nova:** "Does that mean you're not shooting us?"
    *   **Gh0st:** "My systems won't allow it. Truce. Until I get answers."

## EVT_W2_04: Anchor Drill
*   **Trigger:** First rest after Gh0st's truce (post-MQ_09, safe node).
*   **Action:**
    *   Night in the ruins. Bioluminescent spores drift like slow snow.
    *   Zeke is bandaging a cut. Nova reaches for Link again—trying to help—and the connection shrieks. Her vision fuzzes with static.
    *   Orion catches her wrist. Gentle, firm.
    *   **Orion:** "Stop. You are burning the wire."
    *   Nova blinks, breathing hard.
    *   **Nova:** "I can handle it. I just need to focus."
    *   **Orion:** "Focus isn't the problem. Physics is. No single wire can hold a thunderstorm."
    *   He gestures to the others.
    *   **Orion:** "You are the Spark. You open the door. But if you try to hold the energy alone, you will melt."
    *   He points to Zeke. "He is the Ground. When the static gets too high, you push it to him. He dissipates it."
    *   He points to Gh0st. "He is the Shield. He contains the heat so it doesn't leak."
    *   **Nova:** "And you?"
    *   **Orion:** "I am the Tuner. I make sure the noise becomes music."
    *   Orion sets a pebble in her palm.
    *   **Orion:** "Don't lift this alone. Build the circuit. Trust them to carry the weight."
    *   Nova closes her eyes. She doesn't just push; she *connects*.
    *   Zeke shakes his hand like he touched a live wire. "Whoa. Tingly."
    *   Gh0st’s vents hiss softly. "Thermal spike absorbed."
    *   The pebble glows—steady, bright, and cool.
    *   **Orion:** "Better. Again tomorrow."

## EVT_W2_04A: Tideglass Beach (Optional Breather)
*   **Trigger:** Visiting Tideglass Beach (SQ_12, optional).
*   **Action:**
    *   The jungle finally opens onto a shoreline—warm sand that glitters like powdered stars.
    *   Tide pools glow faintly blue. Half-submerged Architect stones hum when waves hit them, like the ocean is strumming a chord.
    *   Zeke drops his pack, stares at the water, and laughs once—surprised it still works.
    *   **Zeke:** "We crash-landed into a postcard."
    *   **Nova:** "Don't get sentimental. You'll ruin your brand."
    *   Orion kneels at the tide line, palm hovering over the foam.
    *   **Orion:** "The music is louder here."
    *   Gh0st stands rigid near the water like it might be an ambush. Then, after a long beat, he unclips his gloves and sits. Awkward. Deliberate.
    *   **Nova:** "You know you can stop guarding us for five minutes."
    *   **Gh0st:** "…Four."
    *   Zeke digs through the wet sand, holding up a cluster of shelled creatures. "Okay. Tideglass Skewers. We eat like humans today."
    *   The scene plays like a rare thing: a family practicing being alive.

## EVT_W2_11: The Ceiling
*   **Trigger:** Launching the Astra (End of World 2).
*   **Action:**
    *   The ship breaks the clouds. The sky turns purple. A massive localized lightning strike from the Shield hits the hull, shaking the cockpit violently.
    *   **Console:** "ALERT. HARD DECK BREACH DETECTED. DEFENSIVE DISCHARGE IMMINENT."
    *   **Zeke:** "Back down! Dive! It's not a wall, it's a zapper!"
    *   Nova forces the stick forward, diving back under the cloud layer just as a second bolt vaporizes the air where they were.
    *   **Nova:** "We're trapped. We can't punch through."
    *   **Orion:** "The Shield is a Phase Curtain. It isolates the sectors. Attempting to cross the border without the Lens to find the frequency gap will disintegrate the hull."
    *   **Zeke:** "So we’re stuck in this bubble until we heist the key."
    *   **Nova:** "Then we need a key. Or a map."
    *   **Zeke:** "The Lens. In the Spire. It sees the frequency gaps."
    *   **Result:** The goal shifts from "Leave Planet" to "Heist the Lens."
