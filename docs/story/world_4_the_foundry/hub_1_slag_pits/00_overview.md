# World 4: The Foundry — Hub 1: Slag Pits

## Overview
Sector 7. A geo-thermal power plant built into an active volcanic range. The Dominion uses the heat to forge their war machines—including Gh0st's unit. It is loud, hot, and dangerous. More importantly, it serves as the fabrication site for the **Ascension Cradle**—a massive psionic amplifier prototype intended for the Orbital Ring. The **Deep-Core Engine** being developed here is not just a power source; it is the heart of the Cradle, designed to sustain the "Great Silence."

## Key Themes
- **The Sabotage:** Stealing the Deep-Core Engine isn't just an upgrade; it actively breaks Vale's timeline for Ascension.
- **Vengeance:** Gh0st is back where he was "born."
- **Industry:** The machinery of war.
- **Creation:** The Anvil Relic is used here to mass-produce weapons.
- **Breather:** A hidden Cooling Springs node—steam, water, and a rare quiet moment in the heat.
- **Fallout (Stinger):** Orbital Compliance stops being a voice and becomes the tyrant (Vale relieves Thorne).

## Character Beats
- **Gh0st:** “Property” → person (origin revealed, choice asserted).
- **Nova:** Learns mastery is earned (first Construct misfire + recovery).

## Transition Points
- **From Spire:** Via *The Astra* (Atmospheric Flight).
- **To Void:** Via *The Astra* (High-Orbit Flight - Requires Upgrade).
