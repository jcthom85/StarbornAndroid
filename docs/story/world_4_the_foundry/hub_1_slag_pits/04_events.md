# Events — World 4: The Foundry

## EVT_W4_01: Compliance Bulletin
*   **Trigger:** Landing in Sector 7 (start MQ_17).
*   **Action:**
    *   *The Astra* drops into the Foundry’s heat haze. Ash smears the sky like a bruise.
    *   The factory’s PA crackles to life—too clear to be local.
    *   **PA (Clean, Polite):** "ORBITAL COMPLIANCE. Lieutenant Arden Vale."
    *   **Vale (PA):** "Sector 7 is under audit. Unregistered craft detected."
    *   **Vale (PA):** "All personnel: initiate containment protocols. No departures until the anomaly is resolved."
    *   Gh0st’s posture tightens like a safety catching.
    *   **Zeke:** "He’s here."
    *   **Gh0st:** "He’s everywhere."

## EVT_W4_02: The Truth
*   **Trigger:** Accessing the Project Phantom terminal (MQ_18).
*   **Action:**
    *   Terminal header: **ORBITAL COMPLIANCE // PROJECT ASCENSION // CLASSIFIED**
    *   Subheader: **ASCENSION CRADLE PROTOTYPE // STATUS: CRITICAL**
    *   Subheader: **DEEP-CORE ENGINE // CALIBRATION: PENDING HEART-SYNC**
    *   The screen shows a schematic of a massive, terrifying structure—the Cradle—designed to bridge the physical and psionic realms.
    *   A hidden audio log from Rylos plays, his voice low and cracking.
    *   **Rylos (Audio):** "Vale doesn't want Harmony. He wants a lobotomy. The Cradle isn't a bridge; it's a funnel. If we turn this on, there won't be enough 'self' left in the sector to remember a name. Thorne wanted a monopoly... Vale wants a cemetery."
    *   **Rylos (Audio):** "The Deep-Core Engine is the only thing that can jumpstart it. If it leaves the Foundry, his timeline collapses. But if he catches me even thinking about a delay..." He trails off into static.
    *   Nova looks at the schematics, then at Gh0st.
    *   **Gh0st:** "He's building a coffin for the world."
    *   **Nova:** "Then we steal the heart."
    *   The terminal then transitions to the Project Phantom data (Elara neural map, Gh0st chip insertion).
    *   **Gh0st:** "I... I am not her brother. I am her backup."
    *   He looks at Nova like the missing puzzle piece is finally visible. "That's why I couldn't fire."
    *   **Nova:** "No. You're you."

## EVT_W4_03: The Protocol
*   **Trigger:** Cooling Springs safe node after EVT_W4_02 (mandatory breather beat).
*   **Action:**
    *   They find the Cooling Springs by accident—a maintenance pocket where condensed runoff turns to hot pools.
    *   Steam rolls across the floor in slow waves. For the first time in this place, the noise fades.
    *   **Zeke:** "We infiltrate a death-factory and end up at a volcano spa. Sure."
    *   Orion’s shoulders lower a fraction. Nova realizes she’s been clenching her jaw since the Wilds.
    *   Gh0st sits just off the waterline with his blade stripped on a cloth—cleaning parts with automatic precision.
    *   Nova watches him for a while, then sits across the small gap of bare floor between them.
    *   Gh0st taps his visor. A red line of text replays in his HUD: **SPECTRAL MATCH DETECTED. LETHAL LOCK: ENABLED.**
    *   **Gh0st:** "My kill-suite doesn't read faces. It reads Spectral IDs."
    *   **Nova:** "The chordprint thing."
    *   He nods once. "When you channel the Source, you ring close enough to her that the failsafe grabs the wheel."
    *   **Nova:** "So you didn't spare me."
    *   Gh0st's jaw tightens. "The first time? No. The second time, I chose not to strike anyway."
    *   He pushes a small black chip across the floor—his override key. "If I ever draw a blade on you again, you use that. No hesitation."
    *   Zeke, half-asleep against a pipe, cracks one eye. "We are doing feelings in a volcano. Love that for us."
    *   Nova pockets the chip. "Okay. Then we're even. But if you ever throw a canteen at my feet again, I'm throwing it back."
    *   Gh0st almost smiles. Almost.

## EVT_W4_04: First Forge
*   **Trigger:** Acquiring the Anvil (MQ_19).
*   **Action:**
    *   The Anvil hums like an engine trying to sing.
    *   Nova reaches for it and tries to Construct a simple catwalk across a slag river.
    *   The shape forms wrong—twisting into familiar scrap-metal geometry—then collapses mid-air.
    *   Nova slips. Gh0st yanks her back by the collar as heat rolls up.
    *   **Orion:** "It answers intention. Doubt becomes debris."
    *   Nova swallows the fear, nods once, and tries again—slower.

## EVT_W4_05: The Confrontation
*   **Trigger:** Meeting Rylos (MQ_20).
*   **Action:**
    *   Rylos stands on the Titan Walker.
    *   **Rylos:** "Asset 404. Return to the dock for reformatting."
    *   **Gh0st:** draws his blade. "My name is Gh0st. And I'm resigning."
    *   *Boss Fight Begins:* Titan Walker.
    *   The Walker buckles and slams into the platform. Heat washes over the arena in a breathless wave.
    *   Rylos spills out of the cockpit, coughing, reaching for a sidearm like it’s a ritual.
    *   **Rylos:** "You're malfunctioning."
    *   **Gh0st:** "No. I'm choosing."
    *   Rylos sneers at Nova. "He isn't a person. He's a product. I wrote him."
    *   Gh0st steps closer—slow, controlled. The blade is steady, but his hands aren’t empty of emotion anymore.
    *   **Nova (quiet):** "Your call."
    *   Gh0st holds the aim for one long beat—then lowers the blade.
    *   **Gh0st:** "You don't get to make me into you."
    *   He turns his back on Rylos and walks away.
    *   Zeke exhales like he’s been holding it since the Wilds. "Okay. Okay. We are not doing murder in a volcano. Great growth."
    *   Orion nods once—approval without ceremony. "Choice is the point."
    *   **Escape begins:** The crew grabs the Deep-Core Engine and runs for *The Astra* as the Foundry starts to die behind them.

## EVT_W4_06: Compliance Coup
*   **Trigger:** During the escape launch (end MQ_20). (Stinger.)
*   **Action:**
    *   Sirens smear into a single panicked note as the crew sprints down a catwalk toward *The Astra*.
    *   Behind them, the Foundry throws sparks like a dying star.
    *   A comm channel crackles to life—Rylos, ragged and furious, calling upward like a man praying to a machine.
    *   **Rylos (Comms):** "Orbital—requesting emergency extraction. Now."
    *   The answer is immediate—too clean for a dying factory.
    *   **Vale (Comms):** "Commander Rylos. Audit complete."
    *   **Vale (Comms):** "You were right to be terrified of the Cradle. But doubt is a frequency I cannot allow in the Soloist's choir."
    *   **Vale (Comms):** "Denied."
    *   A red compliance stamp flashes across local monitors: **TERMINATION AUTHORIZED.**
    *   The Titan Walker’s containment locks snap shut and the cockpit goes white-hot.
    *   Gh0st doesn’t look away. "Even him."
    *   **Zeke:** "He just deleted his own director of murder."
    *   A second message overlays the air like a system update:
    *   **ORBITAL COMMAND TRANSFER // DIRECTOR MARA THORNE: RELIEVED**
    *   The Foundry’s PA booms—polite, clinical, inhumanly calm.
    *   **PA (Vale):** "ORBITAL COMPLIANCE DIRECTIVE. ALL SECTORS: LOCKDOWN."
    *   Dominion drones that were hunting the crew hesitate mid-flight—then peel away, retasked to seal bulkheads and sterilize the sector. The chaos buys the party seconds.
    *   The air itself seems to “ping” as a new layer asserts control: **HARMONY OVERRIDE // SOLOIST VARIANT: ARMED.**
    *   Vale’s voice drops into the crew’s comms, addressed to Nova like she’s a case file.
    *   **Vale (Comms):** "Receiver. You are an ungoverned variable."
    *   **Vale (Comms):** "You will not leave this world with my instruments."
    *   Orion’s voice is low, tight. "He just made himself the warden of the sky."
    *   Nova grips the Anvil case until her knuckles ache. "Then we go to the Ring. We end this."
