# Combat Systems: Elemental Damage Types

**Status:** Locked
**Context:** World 1 (Mining Colony) & Global Lore

Starborn uses a 6-element system. These are not just "colors" of damage but represent specific physical or esoteric interactions with the game world.

---

## World 1 Teaching Focus (Onboarding)
World 1 is a tutorial world, so we should not ask the player to internalize all six elements immediately.
*   **Primary (World 1):** Physical / Shock / Burn (establishes Bio vs. Machine logic fast).
*   **Secondary (World 1):** Acid (introduced via an optional mod / anti-armor lesson).
*   **Late (World 1):** Source (arrives as a Relic/Source Art—framed as rare/ultimate, not a full "matchup chart" the player must memorize yet).
*   **Hold for later:** Freeze exists in the system, but should not be required or tutorialized in World 1.

## 1. Physical
**"The Skin against the Skin."**
*   **Source:** Solid matter collisions. Bullets, mining drills, falling rocks, melee impacts, shrapnel.
*   **Lore:** The most common force in the Dominion. It is brute force physics—Newton’s laws applied with violent intent.
*   **Gameplay Role:**
    *   **Standard Damage:** The baseline for most weapons.
    *   **Strengths:** Reliable against unarmored targets ("Soft" enemies like Workers or Vermin).
    *   **Weaknesses:** Heavily mitigated by Armor and Plating.
    *   **Tempo Trigger:** Weakness hits on Soft/Unarmored targets reduce active Cooldowns by 1 Turn.

## 2. Shock (Energy/Tech)
**"The Spark seeking the Ground."**
*   **Source:** Electricity, overloaded cables, stun batons, robotic discharge, arc-welders.
*   **Lore:** The lifeblood of the Colony. In combat, it overloads circuits and fries nervous systems.
*   **Gameplay Role:**
    *   **Anti-Machine:** Critical for fighting Drones, Loaders, and Turrets.
    *   **Disruption:** Often paired with "Short" or stun payloads (to be defined).
    *   **Weaknesses:** Poor against insulated targets (e.g., Hazmat suits).
    *   **Tempo Trigger:** Weakness hits on Robotic/Electronic targets reduce active Cooldowns by 1 Turn.

## 3. Burn (Thermal-Hot)
**"Agitation and Meltdown."**
*   **Source:** Plasma cutters, explosions, geothermal vents, incendiary compounds.
*   **Lore:** Rapid energy transfer. In the Mines, heat is a constant danger; weaponized, it turns protection into an oven.
*   **Gameplay Role:**
    *   **Raw Damage:** High damage output.
    *   **Anti-Biological:** Devastating against organic foes (Vermin, Humans).
    *   **Weaknesses:** Less effective against heat-shielded mining gear.
    *   **Tempo Trigger:** Weakness hits on Biological targets reduce active Cooldowns by 1 Turn.

## 4. Freeze (Thermal-Cold)
**"Stasis and Brittleness."**
*   **Source:** Liquid nitrogen, void exposure, coolant leaks, cryo-inductors.
*   **Lore:** The halting of vibration. Freeze doesn't just chill; it makes matter rigid and fragile, compromising structural integrity.
*   **Gameplay Role:**
    *   **Utility/Control:** Often lower raw damage but high utility.
    *   **Setup:** Used to make enemies "Brittle" (weakening armor for Physical follow-ups).
    *   **Weaknesses:** Ineffective against enemies with high internal heat generation.
    *   **Tempo Trigger:** Weakness hits on Overheated/Fragile targets reduce active Cooldowns by 1 Turn.

## 5. Acid (Chemical/Entropy)
**"The Silence eating the Signal."**
*   **Source:** Industrial acid, rust, toxic gas, waste runoff.
*   **Lore:** The degradation of form. In the "Ocean" metaphor, this is rot. It is the physical breaking down of bonds.
*   **Gameplay Role:**
    *   **Anti-Armor:** specifically designed to degrade Armor values permanently or over time.
    *   **Attrition:** Good for long fights or high-health targets.
    *   **Tempo Trigger:** Weakness hits on Heavily Plated/Industrial targets reduce active Cooldowns by 1 Turn.

## 6. Source (Esoteric)
**"The Song that rewrites the Room."**
*   **Source:** The Echo Relics (Tuning Fork), Nova’s Source Arts, Aethel signature.
*   **Lore:** Pure frequency. It does not smash or burn; it vibrates the target's reality until it fails. It is the "Magic" of Starborn.
*   **Gameplay Role:**
    *   **Shield Pierce:** Bypasses physical defenses (Armor/Shields) entirely.
    *   **Rare:** Very few enemies resist this in World 1.
    *   **Special:** Primarily accessible via Nova's abilities or Relic interactions.
    *   **Tempo Trigger:** Weakness hits on Hardened Tech/Source Beasts reduce active Cooldowns by 1 Turn.
