# World 5: The Void — Hub 1: Dominion Orbital Ring

## Overview
The "Halo" of the planet. A massive space station ring where the Dominion's elite live and where Project Harmony is being launched. Gravity is artificial. The silence is deafening.

## Key Themes
- **Isolation:** You are in the belly of the beast.
- **Revelation:** The true purpose of the Dominion is revealed.
- **After the Coup:** Orbital Compliance is no longer “support”—it’s the regime.
- **False Paradise (Breather):** The Solarium Deck—plants, a fake sun, even a “beach”—built for executives while the planet below starves.
- **The Soloist:** Vale isn’t selling Harmony; he’s rewriting reality.
- **The Fixer:** Vale is the polite voice behind the alarms… and the hand on the throat.

## Character Beats
- **Gh0st:** Reunion → loss → choice (weapon vs person).
- **Thorne:** Confession reveals Harmony is a product-cage—and Vale is something worse.
- **Nova:** Stasis fails on Vale; “hard work beats destiny” is tested at the worst moment.
- **Zeke:** Confronts the machine he escaped (self-worth vs usefulness foreshadow).
- **Orion:** Names the Great Silence for what it is: a repeating Architect atrocity.

## Transition Points
- **From Foundry:** Via *The Astra* (Space Flight).
- **To Source:** Via The Tear (Reality Breakdown).
