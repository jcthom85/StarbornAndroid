# Events — World 5: The Void

## EVT_W5_01: The Halo
*   **Trigger:** Approaching the Orbital Ring (start MQ_21).
*   **Action:**
    *   *The Astra* rises into the black and the planet falls away beneath it—blue oceans, bruised clouds, and the faint shimmer of the Shield like a second atmosphere.
    *   Ahead: the Orbital Ring. A perfect circle of metal and light, too large to feel real.
    *   **Zeke:** "Okay. Cool. We're boarding a god’s wedding ring."
    *   **Nova:** "If you make one more joke I'm opening the airlock."
    *   Orion leans toward the viewport like he can hear it. "So much noise… trapped in steel."
    *   A clean transmission pings their console—no static, no negotiation.
    *   **PA (Clean, Polite):** "UNREGISTERED CRAFT DETECTED. ORBITAL COMPLIANCE ASSUMES CONTROL."
    *   A second line follows, colder for being procedural: **DIRECTOR MARA THORNE: RELIEVED // COMPLIANCE REVIEW: ACTIVE.**
    *   **Zeke (quiet):** "That's not station security."

## EVT_W5_02: Compliance Greeting
*   **Trigger:** Forced docking complete (end MQ_21 / start MQ_22).
*   **Action:**
    *   The airlock cycles. Their boots hit bright-white flooring. The corridor smells like disinfectant and money.
    *   A holographic safety poster flickers on—then reconfigures into a live feed.
    *   Lieutenant Arden Vale stands in-frame, immaculate uniform, hands folded behind his back like a hotel concierge.
    *   **Vale:** "Welcome to the Ring. For your safety, remain where you are."
    *   **Vale:** "Director Thorne is unavailable. Orbital Compliance is acting command."
    *   **Vale:** "Director Thorne sells Harmony. I believe in throughput."
    *   His gaze lands on Nova’s Echo marks. He doesn’t flinch. He studies.
    *   **Vale:** "Sync established. That's what the old songs call you, isn't it?"
    *   The feed cuts. Every door in the corridor locks at once.
    *   **Gh0st:** "I know that voice."

## EVT_W5_02A: Solarium Deck (Breather)
*   **Trigger:** Entering the Solarium Deck during MQ_22 (mandatory route beat).
*   **Action:**
    *   A sealed hatch cycles and the station’s white sterility opens into color.
    *   A biodome stretches out under curved glass: trees, real soil, clean water—wealth made physical.
    *   A strip of pale sand sits under a warm artificial sun. It would be a beach if it wasn’t inside a cage.
    *   **Zeke:** "They built a vacation in space."
    *   **Nova:** "And I bet the towels are branded."
    *   Orion steps forward like he’s afraid the green will vanish if he breathes wrong.
    *   **Orion:** "Life… kept on a shelf."
    *   Gh0st watches a security drone glide past the “beach,” slow and lazy as a lifeguard.
    *   **Gh0st:** "It’s still a perimeter."
    *   Nova kneels and presses her fingers into the sand. For a second she just feels it: warmth, grit, *real*.
    *   **Nova:** "Remember this. So we don't start thinking their cage is a gift."
    *   A soft chime. Vale’s voice, distant and polite, slides through the dome speakers like a knife in velvet.
    *   **Vale (PA):** "Unauthorized presence detected in leisure sector. Do not run. Running is inefficient."
    *   Zeke exhales. "Okay. Beach trip’s over."
    *   The crew slips into a service hatch and the color drops away behind them like a curtain.

## EVT_W5_03: The Great Silence (Mainframe Log)
*   **Trigger:** First access to the Server Farm terminal (MQ_22).
*   **Action:**
    *   Zeke jacks into a maintenance console. The UI is Dominion clean… until a second layer bleeds through: glyphs like musical notation.
    *   File tree scrolls by:
        *   **ARCHITECT PROTOCOL // GREAT SILENCE**
        *   **HARMONY // RESTART ATTEMPT**
        *   **PHASE CURTAIN // CORRIDOR CONTROL**
        *   **VIRTUOSO // FOCI CALIBRATION**
    *   Orion goes still. "I've seen this pattern."
    *   **Orion:** "It's not Dominion. It's older. This is an Architect ladder."
    *   A director’s log autoplays—Thorne’s voice, warm with certainty.
    *   **Thorne (Log):** "Project Harmony is not philosophy. It’s infrastructure."
    *   **Thorne (Log):** "Phase curtain corridors. Chordprint locks. Relay augments. Virtuoso prototypes. A portfolio."
    *   **Thorne (Log):** "No strikes. No riots. No leaks. A labor world that pays for itself forever."
    *   **Thorne (Log):** "And a Director who never has to retire—or answer to a board."
    *   The log glitches. A second recording splices in—Thorne again, but hoarse, close to the mic, terrified.
    *   **Thorne (Emergency Addendum):** "If you're hearing this, he's locked me out."
    *   **Thorne (Emergency Addendum):** "Harmony was supposed to be controllable. Sellable. Mine."
    *   **Thorne (Emergency Addendum):** "Vale isn't greedy. He's a believer."
    *   **Thorne (Emergency Addendum):** "He'll burn the world to 'save' it."
    *   **Thorne (Emergency Addendum):** "Stop him. Stop my mistake."
    *   A second annotation overlays it in a different hand: clinical, minimal.
    *   **VALE ADDENDUM:** *Harmony produces a choir. A choir produces variance. Variance produces pain.*  
    *   **VALE ADDENDUM:** *Solution: Soloist.*
    *   Zeke swallows. "He's not the loyal type, is he."

## EVT_W5_04: The Reunion
*   **Trigger:** Entering the Core (MQ_23).
*   **Action:**
    *   The Core is a cathedral of servers. In the center, a tank of shimmering fluid—Elara suspended inside, wires blooming from her spine like black coral.
    *   **Gh0st:** "Found you."
    *   He reaches for the glass. The air ripples. A translucent avatar—Elara in the Source—flickers into existence.
    *   She looks at Gh0st. Her eyes aren't blank. They are sharp, tired, and present.
    *   **Elara (Avatar):** "734. You're late."
    *   **Gh0st:** "Elara." He sounds broken. "I'm getting you out."
    *   **Elara (Avatar):** "No time. Vale is rewriting the root code. He's using me as the processor."
    *   She winces, her avatar flickering as red warning lights bathe the room. The blast doors start to close—Dominion security override.
    *   **Elara (Avatar):** "I can't hold the door and the firewall at the same time."
    *   She looks Gh0st dead in the eye. "Take the Anchor. Get them out. That is a direct order, brother."
    *   **Gh0st:** "I am not leaving you."
    *   **Elara (Avatar):** "You are if you want to win."
    *   She shoves her hand into the digital stream. The blast doors groan and force open.
    *   **Elara (Avatar):** "GO! Before I lose the thread!"
    *   Nova grabs the Anchor. The station shakes. Elara’s avatar looks at Gh0st one last time—softening.
    *   **Elara (Avatar):** "You look good, 734. Different."
    *   She flickers out. The blast doors slam shut, but the party is on the other side.
    *   **Zeke:** "She's... she's still in there."
    *   **Gh0st:** "She's fighting. So do we."

## EVT_W5_05: The Soloist
*   **Trigger:** Reaching the Throne Room (MQ_24).
*   **Action:**
    *   The Throne Room is glass and stars—and a single human figure behind a containment field.
    *   Thorne looks smaller here. No cameras. No speeches. Just a woman who built a ladder and assumed she would be the one to climb it.
    *   **Thorne:** "He did it. He took command. He calls it compliance."
    *   **Nova:** "You started this."
    *   Thorne swallows. "Yes."
    *   **Thorne:** "I thought if I owned the Source, I'd never be powerless again."
    *   **Thorne:** "Harmony was leverage. A leash I could sell as mercy."
    *   **Thorne:** "I didn't build a heaven. I built a cage."
    *   She looks at the Anchor case in Nova’s hands like it’s a confession.
    *   **Thorne:** "He's going to use you. The Receiver. He can't hold the instruments without a living interface."
    *   Nova’s pulse thuds. "And Elara?"
    *   Thorne’s voice breaks. "A key. A battery. A crime."
    *   The containment field flickers. A new channel opens—calm, close, inevitable.
    *   **Vale:** "Director. Thank you for building the ladder."
    *   Thorne jerks against her restraints. "Vale—don't do this."
    *   Nova raises a hand and fires Stasis—too fast, too hopeful.
    *   The room freezes for half a breath… except **Vale**. He steps through the effect like it’s fog.
    *   Feedback snaps into Nova’s teeth. She stumbles.
    *   Orion grips her elbow. "Anchor." Nova forces air into her lungs and stays upright.
    *   Vale walks past Nova like she’s weather and stops in front of Thorne.
    *   **Vale:** "You built a cage and called it mercy."
    *   **Vale:** "I will end suffering. Completely."
    *   Vale drives a psionic spike through Thorne.
    *   **Vale:** "A choir still contains variance."
    *   **Vale:** "Variance contains pain."
    *   **Vale:** "One voice. A solo."
    *   Thorne disintegrates into blue dust, swallowed by the glass-light of the room.
    *   The Ring screams—lights dim, gravity stutters, the Shield lattice outside ripples like a wounded skin.
    *   Vale absorbs the station’s energy as if inhaling.
    *   His silhouette fractures into geometry wearing a human outline.
    *   **The Ascended:** "Follow me, Receiver. Let's see what's on the other side."
    *   Space tears open. The Tear is not black—it’s *music without speakers*.
    *   Elara’s voice flares over comms, suddenly clear.
    *   **Elara (Comms):** "Gh0st—"
    *   A second later the signal is ripped away, pulled toward the Tear.

## EVT_W5_06: Into the Tear
*   **Trigger:** Reaching the Tear / point of no return (end MQ_24).
*   **Action:**
    *   Debris drifts upward like snow in reverse. The Ring is coming apart in slow, impossible angles.
    *   Gh0st stares at the Tear like he can will it to give her back.
    *   **Nova:** "We don't leave people."
    *   **Gh0st:** "She's already gone."
    *   **Orion:** "Not gone. Elsewhere. In the music."
    *   Zeke grips the railing, knuckles white. "If we stay, we die. If we follow him… we might still die. But at least it'll be on purpose."
    *   Nova meets each of their eyes—found family, not fate.
    *   **Nova:** "Then we follow."
    *   They leap.
