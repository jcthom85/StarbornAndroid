# NPCs — World 5: The Void

## Major Characters

### Elara (The Living CPU)
*   **Role:** MacGuffin / Tragic Figure.
*   **Location:** The Anchor Chamber.
*   **State:** Unconscious, wired into the machine. She is processing the Source data for the entire station.
*   **Lore Note:** Project **Virtuoso**—a tuned human conduit + relay augmentation. Her unique relay-harmonic (chordprint) became both an encryption key and a weapon blueprint. Dominion used it as a key in Phantom units (the **Harmonic Lock** failsafe).
*   **Fate:** Pulled into the Tear.

### Director Mara Thorne (The Deposed)
*   **Role:** Victim / Quest Giver.
*   **Location:** Server Farm (Hiding in vents).
*   **State of Mind:** **Terrified.** The "Director" mask is gone. She is a woman hiding from her own creation.
*   **Function:** Gives access codes to the Throne Room. Confesses that Harmony was a cage.
*   **Fate:** Executed by **Vale** in the Throne Room (Cinematic).
*   **Key Line:** "I built the cage. I didn't know he wanted to burn the zoo."

### Lieutenant Arden Vale (The Ascended)
*   **Role:** The True Villain.
*   **Location:** Throne Room.
*   **Appearance:** Unnaturally calm. He doesn't blink.
*   **Dialogue:** "Director. You are clutter. Please delete yourself."

## Hostiles

### HK-Droid (Hunter-Killer)
*   **Role:** Unstoppable Pursuer.
*   **Appearance:** Skeletal chrome frame. Red optic sensor.
*   **Mechanic:** Cannot be killed. **Stasis** (Anchor Relic) freezes them for 3 turns.
*   **Bark:** *Silence.* (They do not speak).
