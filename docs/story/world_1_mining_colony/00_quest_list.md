# World 1 Quest List (Canonical)

This file is the single source of truth for World 1 quest IDs, titles, objectives, beats, and rewards.
Canonical key item name: Mine Access Badge (UI can label it "Mining Pass" if needed, but use one label consistently).

## Side Quests (World 1)

| ID | Title | Hub | Quest Giver | Objective | Reward (canonical) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **W1_SQ01** | **The Scavenger's Stash** | Hub 1 | Scrapper (Fence) | Track down a hidden cache | Nova Skill: Pulse Grenade |
| **W1_SQ02** | **System Flush** | Hub 1 | Doc (Medic) | Clear contaminated vents / chemical hazard | Weapon Mod: Corrosive Rounds (Applies Corrosion / Acid DoT for Nova's guns) |
| **W1_SQ03** | **Heavy Lifting** | Hub 1 | Foreman Bogs | Use loader/mech to move cargo / clear path | Nova Skill: Hydraulic Kick (Guard Break/Stagger) |
| **W1_SQ04** | **Protocol Override** | Hub 2 | Hacked Terminal (Server Room) | Restore / spoof access protocols | Passive: Admin Access (Hacking speed/efficiency up) |
| **W1_SQ05** | **The Lost Shift** | Hub 2 | Datapad (Deep Mine) | Find out what happened to the missing crew | Weapon Mod: Recoil Dampener |

**World 1 teaching note:** W1 should not build tutorials/puzzles around **Jammed** or **Marked** (Zeke joins too late). Keep World 1 focused on reactive/brute-force status learning and make **Guard Break/Stagger** (via **W1_SQ03 "Heavy Lifting"**) mandatory or strongly signposted before the Logistics/Warden run.
