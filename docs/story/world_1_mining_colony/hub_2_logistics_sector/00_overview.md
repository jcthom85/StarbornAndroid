# World 1: The Mines — Hub 2: Logistics Sector

## Overview
Separated from the grime of the Homestead Quarter by a heavy blast door, the Logistics Sector is where Dominion manages the ore—and the people. It is sterile, bureaucratic, and heavily guarded.

## Key Themes
- **Bureaucracy:** The banality of evil. Forms, queues, and bored clerks.
- **The Threshold:** This is the gateway to the danger zone (The Mines).
- **Escape:** The Cargo Rail leads off-world.

## Transition Points
- **From Hub 1:** Via the Transit Checkpoint.
- **To Mines:** Via the Deep Elevator.
- **To The Crash Interlude:** Via the Cargo Launch Bay (The Escape).
