# Events — World 1, Hub 2: Logistics Sector

## EVT_W1_04: The Meeting
*   **Trigger:** MQ_02 (Approaching Window 4).
*   **Action:**
    *   **Zeke:** "Name? ID? Clearance Sco—oh. It's you. The 'volunteer'."
    *   **Nova:** "I need a mining pass, suit. Shift starts in ten."
    *   **Zeke:** "Let me just check your eligibility..."
    *   He taps his screen. He stops. The color drains from his face.
    *   **Console:** **STATUS: MANDATORY RETIREMENT. ASSET LIABILITY > PROJECTED VALUE. RECYCLE.**
    *   Zeke looks at the screen, then at Nova. He swallows hard.
    *   **Zeke:** "Recycle Asset... do you know what that code means?"
    *   **Nova:** "It means I'm fired?"
    *   **Zeke:** "It means bio-reclamation. Death. They're going to kill you, Nova. For a *breaker*."
    *   He stares at the "Confirm" button blinking on his console. His hand hovers over it.
    *   **Zeke:** "I process these every day. I never... I never looked at the person."
    *   He looks at Nova—breathing, dirty, alive.
    *   **Zeke:** "I'm not doing it. I'm not signing a death warrant for a spreadsheet."
    *   He types a furious command. The red text vanishes.
    *   **Zeke:** "I just flagged the surge as 'Grid Instability'. Not your fault. Temporary override."
    *   He slides the chit under the glass, his hand shaking violently.
    *   **Nova:** "Why?"
    *   **Zeke:** "Because they're trying to kill you. And I won't help them."

## EVT_W1_05: The Escape
*   **Trigger:** MQ_05 (Launch Bay).
*   **Action:**
    *   The Warden crashes through the ceiling.
    *   **Warden:** "Asset Forfeiture In Progress. Terminating subject."
    *   **PA (Orbital Compliance):** "Pause. Termination is wasteful, Warden. Simply break the legs and recycle the biological material."
    *   The Warden hesitates, his visor twitching.
    *   **Warden (Gritting teeth):** "Acknowledged. Breaking legs."
    *   **Zeke:** "I hacked the pod! I spliced Jed's Ghost Signal Cell into the core. It's the only way it clears the rail!"
    *   Nova and Zeke jump into the pod.
    *   The Pod shoots up the rail.
    *   **Console:** "AUTO-NAV: UNKNOWN SIGNAL LOCK."
    *   **Zeke:** "I can't override it!"
    *   The Planetary Shield blooms—solid outside the corridor. Impact. The pod spirals toward Sector 9.
    *   Fade to Black.
