# World 1: Mining Colony — Hub 1: Homestead Quarter

## Overview
This is the starting hub for Nova. It serves as the onboarding zone where the player learns the basics of movement, interaction, and the world state. The atmosphere is "working class sci-fi" — industrial, lived-in, but relatively safe compared to the mines.

## Key Themes
- **Normalcy before the storm:** Showing Nova's daily life before the cosmic plot kicks in.
- **Corporate Presence:** Dominion is here, but currently just "the boss," not "the villain."
- **Community:** The people here know each other.

## Transition Points
- **To Trade Row:** Open access.
- **To Stellarium Mine:** Initially gated/guarded until tutorial steps are complete.
