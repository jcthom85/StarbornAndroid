## Major Characters

### Jed (The Mentor)
*   **Role:** Nova’s surrogate father. Retired engineer.
*   **Location:** The Workshop (Home).
*   **Function:** Tutorial Guide. Gives MQ_01; hands off the **Chime** (Ghost Signal Cell) at the Cargo Lift sacrifice (end of MQ_04 / start of MQ_05 flow).
*   **Dialogue Style:** Gruff, protective, technical.
*   **Key Line:** "I didn't raise you to be a hero, Nova. I raised you to survive. Now use those legs and RUN."

*   **Function:** Introduces the "Anomaly" plot. Buffer/Debuffer.
*   **Dialogue Style:** Nervous, uses corporate buzzwords ("Optimal," "Compliance") to hide panic.
*   **Vibe:** Earnest but terrified. He tries to recruit Nova for a "Volunteer Committee" because he genuinely thinks rules save lives. He learns the hard way they don't.
*   **Key Line:** "I accessed your file to help, and the system logged a Level 4 breach. I'm not a rebel, Nova. I'm just a loose end."
