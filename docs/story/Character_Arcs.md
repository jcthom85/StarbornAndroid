# Character Arcs

This document outlines the emotional journeys and structural development of the main cast. Each character is built around a "Lie" (their starting false belief) and a "Truth" (the realization that completes their arc).

## 1. Nova — The Catalyst

*   **The Lie:** "I’m just a rat in the walls. If I keep my head down and survive, that’s enough."
*   **The Truth:** "I am part of something bigger. Power isn't about surviving; it's about choosing who you save."

| World | State of Mind | Key Beat / Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1: The Mines** | Survival. Scared, reactive. Wants to run away. | **Inciting Incident:** She grabs the Relic not to be a hero, but because she’s cornered. Loses Jed because she wasn't ready to fight. |
| **2: The Wilds** | Overwhelmed. Tries to "brute force" the Source (panic-channelling). | **The Lesson:** Orion forces her to stop running. She learns to listen to the Source, not just scream at it. |
| **3: The Spire** | Competent. Starts to enjoy the power. Feels like a "cool" rebel. | **The Test:** Leads the heist. Confidence borders on arrogance. She thinks she can outsmart the Administrator effortlessly. |
| **4: The Foundry** | Responsibility. Realizes her power has consequences for others. | **The Pivot:** She uses her power to support Gh0st’s revenge, putting his needs above the mission. A leader’s choice. |
| **5: The Void** | Failure. Tries to fix everything alone with "Stasis." Arrogant. | **Low Point:** Vale defeats her easily because she tries to control him. She realizes brute force (even Source power) can’t fix a broken soul. |
| **6: The Source** | Acceptance. Rejects "Perfect Control." | **Climax:** She gives up the god-like power to save her friends. She wins by letting go, proving she is no longer the scared rat. |

## 2. Zeke — The Insider

*   **The Lie:** "I’m a coward. I can only fix things from the inside by following the rules."
*   **The Truth:** "I am brave. Rules are just code, and I can rewrite them to protect my friends."

| World | State of Mind | Key Beat / Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1: The Mines** | Complicit. Watching Nova on screens. "Just doing my job." | **The Turn:** Deletes the footage of Nova. Physically leaves his safe booth to help her, burning his entire career/life in 5 minutes. |
| **2: The Wilds** | Useless. Feels like dead weight in the jungle. Can’t "hack" a tree. | **The Growth:** Realizes his knowledge of history (not just code) helps them understand the ruins. He finds his new utility. |
| **3: The Spire** | Haunted. Back in civilization, he’s terrified of being recognized. | **The Confrontation:** Has to bluff a Dominion guard using his old "HR voice." He realizes he can use his past as a weapon, not just a shame. |
| **4: The Foundry** | Angry. Sees how the sausage is made (Gh0st’s creation). | **The Bond:** He connects with Gh0st—the "software guy" understanding the "hardware guy." He hacks the assembly line to save Gh0st. |
| **5: The Void** | Regret. Sees the full scale of what he helped build. | **Low Point:** He is locked out of the system by Vale. His "Insider" status means nothing. He feels he has nothing left to offer. |
| **6: The Source** | Resolved. He stops looking for a system to join. | **Climax:** He doesn't hack a computer; he "hacks" the group dynamic, keeping them together when reality breaks. He is the glue. |

## 3. Gh0st — The Weapon

*   **The Lie:** "I am a thing. I have no name, only a function. I follow orders."
*   **The Truth:** "I am a person. I choose who I protect."

| World | State of Mind | Key Beat / Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1: The Mines** | Off-screen. | **Active Threat:** He is deployed by Thorne to hunt the Anomaly (Nova). |
| **2: The Wilds** | The Haunting. Confused. Why can’t he pull the trigger? | **The Truce:** The song forces him to pause. He joins purely to observe/wait for the "kill command" to unlock. |
| **3: The Spire** | The Watchdog. Protective of Nova, but claims it's "mission critical." | **The Crack:** He takes a hit meant for Nova without calculating it first. Logic says "dodge," body says "protect." |
| **4: The Foundry** | The Reckoning. Confronts his production line. | **The Choice:** Meets his maker (Rylos). Rylos tries to use the command codes. Gh0st overrides them—not with code, but with will. |
| **5: The Void** | The Brother. Desperate to find Elara. | **Low Point:** Finds Elara, but she is lost/gone. The "rescue" fails. He has to grieve the sister he never really knew. |
| **6: The Source** | The Shield. No more orders. | **Climax:** He stands between the Ascended and Nova. Not because of programming, but because he loves this family. |

## 4. Orion — The Ancient

*   **The Lie:** "My time is over. The silence of my people is my punishment. I should just fade away."
*   **The Truth:** "Life is for the living. I can honor the dead by teaching the new generation."

| World | State of Mind | Key Beat / Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1: The Mines** | Sleeping. | **Passive:** Stasis in the Wilds. Dreaming of the Chorus. |
| **2: The Wilds** | Grief. Wakes up to a dead world. Wants to go back to sleep. | **The Awakening:** Sees Nova struggling with the Source. He can't let her die. He steps up as a reluctant teacher. |
| **3: The Spire** | Judgment. Looks at the Dominion city with disgust. | **The Perspective:** He sees "Aethel tech" bastardized by humans. He has to get over his superiority complex to help them use the tech for good. |
| **4: The Foundry** | Connection. Bonding with the "Artificial" (Gh0st). | **The Wisdom:** He teaches Gh0st that having a "designed purpose" doesn't mean you lack a soul. |
| **5: The Void** | Horror. Recognizes the "Great Silence" protocol. | **Low Point:** Realizes his people weren't just "quiet," they were silenced. The Chorus calls him to join them in death. |
| **6: The Source** | Life. Rejects the Chorus. | **Climax:** He hears his old people calling him home, but he looks at Nova/Zeke/Gh0st and chooses this messy, loud, imperfect family. |

## Implementation Strategy: World 1

To effectively establish these arcs, World 1 needs to emphasize the starting "Lies" for Nova and Zeke:

1.  **Nova (The Survival Instinct):** Show her actively avoiding conflict or hiding. Establish that her primary goal is survival at all costs, setting up the contrast for her later leadership.
2.  **Zeke (The Complicit Employee):** Include dialogue where Zeke parrots corporate policy or enforces rules he clearly dislikes, highlighting his internal struggle and his reliance on the system for safety.
