# Content Volume Standards (The Golden Ratio)

**Status:** Canon
**Purpose:** To define the standard volume of Quests, Side Quests, and Enemies per World to ensure consistent pacing and scope control.

## 1. The Golden Ratio (Per World)
Every World in *Starborn* is divided into **2 Hubs**:
*   **Hub 1:** Town / Safe Zone / Setup (Social & Exploration focus).
*   **Hub 2:** Dungeon / Danger Zone / Climax (Combat & Puzzle focus).

To maintain scope and pacing, every World must adhere to these content limits:

| Content Type | Per World Total | Distribution Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Quests** | **5** | **Hub 1 (Setup):** 2 Quests (Intro + Rising Action)<br>**Hub 2 (Climax):** 3 Quests (Dungeon + Event + Boss) |
| **Side Quests** | **5** | **Hub 1:** 3 Quests (World-building + Early Gear)<br>**Hub 2:** 2 Quests (High-risk exploration / Lore secrets) |
| **New Enemies** | **6–8** | **Common:** 3-4 (Melee, Ranged, Fast/Swarm)<br>**Elite:** 2 (Tank, Support/Caster)<br>**Boss:** 1 (Major Act Boss) |

## 2. The Logic (Why This Number?)

### A. Side Quests are for Loot, Not XP
In *Starborn*, Side Quests (SQs) aren't just filler; they are the primary source of **Mods** and **Unlockable Skills**.
*   **The Rule:** ~1 Side Quest = 1 Meaningful Upgrade (Skill or Weapon Mod).
*   **The Outcome:** 5 SQs per world ensures the player gets ~5 meaningful upgrades per biome without bloating the inventory or overwhelming the player with choices.

### B. Enemy Variety vs. Cognitive Load
With **6-8 new enemies** per world, the player has to learn a specific "combat language" for that biome (e.g., World 1 is "Robots + Bugs").
*   **< 6:** Combat feels repetitive.
*   **> 8:** Combat becomes random; player can't build a strategy.
*   **The Mix:** 6-8 allows for different *combinations* of enemy groups (e.g., 2 Guards + 1 Drone vs. 3 Rock-Borers) to create freshness without needing new assets.

#### World 1 Addendum: Tutorial Cognitive Load (Keep It Lean)
World 1 is the tutorial biome, so its "combat language" must be readable at a glance.
*   **Teach fewer status effects:** Prioritize reactive/brute-force statuses (Stun/Blind/Corrosion) and delay tactical layers (**Jammed**, **Marked**) until World 2 (Zeke joins too late in W1 to build lessons around them).
*   **Make Guard Break/Stagger the star:** World 1 introduces shielded/armored enemies early; players need a clear "this is the key" mechanic before the Warden.
*   **Elements are fine—don’t teach all of them at once:** World 1 can focus on Physical/Shock/Burn (+ Acid via an optional mod) and save deeper element interactions for later worlds.

### C. Main Quest Pacing
*   **Hub 1** is designed to be "Social/Exploration" heavy. Talk to NPCs, get access, learn the culture.
*   **Hub 2** is designed to be "Combat/Dungeon" heavy. Gauntlets, puzzles, boss fights.

## 3. World 1 Template (Applied)

*   **Hub 1 (Homestead):**
    *   **MQ:** 2 (Wake Up Call, Paperwork)
    *   **SQ:** 3 (Scavenger's Stash, System Flush, Heavy Lifting)
*   **Hub 2 (Logistics):**
    *   **MQ:** 3 (The Echo, Red Alert, The Launch)
    *   **SQ:** 2 (Protocol Override, The Lost Shift)
*   **Total:** 5 MQ, 5 SQ.
*   **Bestiary (Enemies):** 7 Unique Entries (4 Common, 2 Elite, 1 Boss).

**World 1 pacing note:** Treat **W1_SQ03 "Heavy Lifting"** as mandatory or strongly signposted, since it teaches **Guard Break/Stagger** and rewards **Hydraulic Kick** (a core tool for shielded enemies leading into the Warden).

This template should be replicated for Worlds 2–6.
