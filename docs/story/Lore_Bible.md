# I. The Cosmology: The Skin and The Ocean

The universe of Starborn operates on two layers of existence.

### 1. The Skin (Physical Reality)
This is the world of matter, atoms, gravity, and corporations. It is rigid, cold, and follows the laws of physics. It is where the Dominion rules. Think of it as **ice**—frozen, solid, and separate.

### 2. the Source (The Ocean)
Beneath the physical layer flows **the Source**. It is a psionic current of pure information and consciousness.
*   **Nature:** It is not a "soul" in the religious sense, but a "carrier wave" of existence. It is an ocean of memory and presence.
*   **The Flow:** When things die, they **melt**. Their water returns to the ocean. When they are born, a scoop of water freezes into a shape (an ego/body).
*   **Visuals:** Represented as vibrating starlight, waveform distortions, and "singing" geometry where it bleeds through.
*   **Names:** Dominion calls it **the Source**. The Aethel call it **Veyra**. Orion calls it **the music**.

### Dominion Engineering Model: Hardened vs. Tunable Reality
Dominion doesn’t treat the Source like mysticism. They treat it like **acoustics**.
*   **Solid-State (Normal Physics):** Steel is steel. Bullets stop in armor. Walls are walls.
*   **Phase-State (Dominion term):** With the right **Source alignment**, matter becomes *tunable*—fields can harden air into barriers, “curtains” can become solid, and specialized impacts can shear through shields that would otherwise be impenetrable.

This is the foundation of Dominion Source-tech: force reality into a controlled phase-state, then profit from the control.

# II. The Ancients & The Relics

Thousands of years ago, a species known only as **The Architects** learned to modulate the Source. They didn't build with stone; they built with sound and frequency. They vanished, leaving behind tools—**Relics** (or Echoes)—that serve as mixing decks for reality.

### The Six Echoes (MacGuffins)
Dominion is digging for these. Each Relic controls a specific aspect of reality.

| Relic | Name | Function | Dominion's Goal | Nova's Power |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 (Mines)** | **The Tuning Fork** | Destabilizes matter boundaries. | To break the barrier between Skin and Vein. | **Blast** (Force/Destruction) |
| **2 (Wilds)** | **The Bridge** | Harmonizes individual consciousnesses. | To network human minds together. | **Link** (Heal/Buff Party) |
| **3 (Spire)** | **The Lens** | Visualizes the Source frequency. | To monitor every thought in the colony. | **Scan (True Sight)** (Reveal secrets/weak points) |
| **4 (Foundry)** | **The Anvil** | Shapes matter from thoughts. | To manufacture infinite resources. | **Construct** (Create barriers/turrets) |
| **5 (Void)** | **The Anchor** | Stabilizes the edited reality. | To make their changes permanent. | **Stasis** (Time stop/CC) |
| **6 (Source)** | **The Key** | Grants "Admin Access" to the Source Signal. | To seize root access and lock in Dominion’s monopoly. | **Ascension** (God Mode) |

### Architects Reveal Ladder (Player-Facing)
This is the intended drip-feed of truth about the Architects. Each reveal should change what the player believes they’re fighting.
*   **World 1 (Mines):** The Echo Relic “speaks” in non-Dominion language ("Sync established"). The chamber geometry is older than the colony. Dominion didn’t invent this—they found it.
*   **World 2 (Wilds):** Sanctuary murals show the Architects using the Bridge to network minds. Orion recognizes the pattern: “Harmony” isn’t a Dominion invention—it’s an ancient weapon.
*   **World 3 (Spire):** Archive fragments imply the Planetary Shield is an Architect **phase curtain** repurposed, and the Lens is a monitoring tool. The player learns the cage has a moving lock.
*   **World 4 (Foundry):** Dominion manufacturing and Project Phantom logs show they are copying Architect logic (Anvil fabrication, chordprint locks) while pretending it’s “progress.” The player learns the machine behind the machine.
*   **World 5 (Void):** The Ring mainframe reveals Project Harmony is a reboot of an Architect-era protocol (the first “Great Silence”). Thorne thinks it’s a product; Vale thinks it’s mercy.
*   **World 6 (Source):** The Key isn’t a treasure—it’s root access. The final question becomes: do you *own* reality, or do you protect it and let go?

### The Architects (Canon Truth)
The Architects were not gods. They were engineers who tried to solve suffering with control.
*   They built the six Echoes as admin instruments for the Source—tools that can network minds, reshape matter, and stabilize edits.
*   Their “Great Silence” was the first forced harmony attempt. It didn’t create peace; it erased people.
*   The relic suite survived as scattered Echoes. Dominion is rebuilding the same ladder with a different logo.

### Chimes (Non-Echo Artifacts)
Chimes are portable Source resonators keyed to a specific psionic signature.
*   **Dominion designation:** Ghost Signal Cell.
*   **Aethel term:** Chime.

They can "handshake" with Source-era locks and dormant systems, but they do not generate sustained power or grant reality-editing on their own.
*   **Orion's Chime:** Twenty years ago, when a Source Beast surfaced in Orion’s lab (Dominion classification), he **jettisoned** a Chime through a launch tube—then put himself into stasis to mute his signal and avoid its search.
*   **How it reaches Nova:** Dominion later recovered it as salvage and it eventually filtered down to the Mining Colony as scrap, where Jed found it.
*   **Function in the story:** It pulls Nova and Zeke's escape pod toward Sector 9 and provides limited Source power to reinitialize the Sanctuary—releasing Orion from stasis and rebooting *The Astra*'s Bridge Relic.
*   **Chorus Response:** When a Chime reactivates, it’s audible inside Veyra. Orion’s people can’t steer ships, but they can **nudge the current**—strengthening the pull toward the Sanctuary once Orion’s signal returns.

### Signalprints (Dominion: Spectral ID)
Direct contact with the Source (especially via Relics) leaves a measurable Source fingerprint in the way a person "rings" when they act, panic, fight, or channel power.
*   **Dominion term:** Spectral ID / Spectral Profile.
*   **Orion's term:** Chordprint.
*   **How it shows up in tech:** Locks, sensors, and weapons can key off the chordprint instead of DNA.
*   **Project Phantom failsafe:** Gh0st-class units carry a **Source Lock** keyed to Elara’s relay-chordprint. If a target matches above threshold, lethal force is locked and a retrieval/protection routine engages.
*   **Why Nova can trip it:** Nova’s output includes a faint Aethel Source thread; Elara’s relay augmentation imprinted a similar Source signature. When Nova channels the Source, she can ping a partial match. It’s not blood—it’s frequency.

# III. The Imprinted: Anomalies

**The Unknown**
To the wider universe, "Relics" are rumors or folklore. Only the Dominion's top-level black program (Project Harmony) understands they are Aethel-made artifacts. The public has no words for them.

**Why Nova?**
Nova is **not** a prophesied hero. She's unlucky, stubborn, and just compatible enough to survive.
*   **The Echo Line:** Nova carries a faint Aethel imprint in her signal (distant ancestry). It doesn't make her powerful. It just means the Echo doesn't instantly reject her.
*   **The Incident:** When she found the Tuning Fork in World 1, it should have disintegrated her (returned her data to the signal).
*   **The Circuit:** A human mind cannot hold the Source alone; it burns out the nerves ("Noise"). To survive, the party forms a living circuit to share the load.
    *   **The Spark (Nova):** Opens the channel and invites the energy in.
    *   **The Ground (Zeke):** Dumps the excess static/heat so the Spark doesn't fry.
    *   **The Shield (Gh0st):** Physically contains the radiation field.
    *   **The Tuner (Orion):** Modulates the frequency so it's music, not chaos.
*   **The Work:** Control isn't genetic. Orion can teach her to tune the signal, but she still has to earn it—discipline, practice, and trust in her team.
*   **The Cost:** The cost is shared. If the circuit breaks, everyone burns.
*   **The Hidden Layer:** Echo marks don’t just let Nova reach *into* the Source—they let the Source reach *back*. Most of the time it’s just pressure, dreams, and imprint-flashes… but it’s also how Orion’s people can touch the physical world at all.

# IV. The Antagonist: Dominion's "Project Harmony"

**Director Mara Thorne is greed in a clean suit.**
She sells Harmony as mercy because it plays well in boardrooms and recruitment ads. But underneath, Thorne’s drive is acquisition: to **own** the Source, to **monopolize** Source-harnessing tech, and to turn an entire planet into a closed, profitable system she controls forever.

Thorne isn’t trying to “save” people. She’s trying to **corner a market** nobody else understands yet.
*   **The Commodity:** the Source is the first new resource since the invention of off-world travel: energy, computation, authentication, surveillance, and—at the top—reality edits.
*   **The Business Model:** Keep the planet sealed (Phase Curtain), extract Echoes, reverse-engineer patterns into scalable products, then sell “Harmony” as a subscription: fewer strikes, fewer riots, fewer leaks.
*   **The Personal Goal:** Money, legacy, and control. A Director who never has to answer to a board again.
*   **Her Moral Line:** She has one. It’s just drawn around *herself* and the company’s survival, not around workers. If a hundred “assets” die to protect the monopoly, she calls it a write-off.
*   **Why she’s not cartoon evil:** She doesn’t enjoy cruelty. She enjoys *winning*. If the numbers go up and the sector stays quiet, she sleeps fine.

**Lieutenant Arden Vale is a radical idealist.**
Vale doesn’t want profit—he wants *purity*. He genuinely believes individuality is cruelty and that suffering is a structural flaw in consciousness. But his solution isn't just silence—it's **total ownership**. He seeks to claim the Chorus, forcing every consciousness in the Source into a single, directed will: his own. In Vale’s mind, becoming the Soloist isn’t conquest; it’s responsibility taken to a monstrous extreme.

### Dominion Planetary Shield (Phase Curtain)
Dominion’s Planetary Shield is not a “bubble.” It’s a **phase curtain** anchored and managed from the Orbital Ring.
*   **Purpose:** Keep the labor worlds sealed, control all off-world traffic, and prevent leaks of Relic research.
*   **How Dominion uses it:** Authorized craft ride **timed corridors** (micro-windows / frequency gaps) keyed to clearance transponders.
*   **Why the party can’t brute-force it:** Outside the corridor, the curtain is effectively solid; unauthorized craft are shredded or deflected.
*   **Why the Lens matters:** The Lens can visualize the moving gap in real time, turning “impossible” into “timed run.”

### Thorne’s Pitch: Project Harmony (A Product)
Thorne wants to use the Six Echoes to build the first scalable Source-exploit: a system that turns minds into managed infrastructure—and turns managed minds into profit.
1.  Crack the boundary between Skin and Source (The Tuning Fork) to access the “resource.”
2.  Network minds (The Bridge) so dissent becomes a solvable engineering problem.
3.  Monitor and contain the planet (The Lens + the Phase Curtain corridors).
4.  Manufacture at will (The Anvil) and stabilize edits (The Anchor).
5.  Take root access (The Key) so Dominion owns the Source outright.

### Dominion Source-Tech (Corporate Reality)
Dominion already builds technology that harnesses the Source in many ways—imperfect, dangerous, and scalable enough to be profitable.
This is their “magitek” ladder: infrastructure → industry → personal weapons.

#### Pillar 1: Logistics (Relay Network)
*   **What it is:** Orbital relays and Source repeaters that keep Dominion commerce and compliance connected.
*   **What it does:** Turns distance into a managed variable—shipping windows, communications priority, and “accidental” shortages that can be blamed on weather.
*   **Story function:** Dominion doesn’t just own labor. It owns the **frequency** that food, medicine, and evacuation rides on.

#### Pillar 2: Defense & Industry (Phase-Tech)
*   **Phase Curtains:** Planetary and facility-scale barriers with timed corridors (the Shield as logistics + prison).
*   **Source Barriers:** Corridor shutters, kill-walls, and containment fields keyed to **chordprints** (Spectral ID).
*   **Phase Tools:** “Drills” and cutters that hum rock into dust instead of spinning—fast, quiet, and brutal.

#### Pillar 3: Warfare (Virtuoso Program)
Machines can generate huge standing fields, but they’re clumsy at *improvisation*. Combat requires microsecond tuning—defense to offense to containment without overheating.
*   **The solution:** A living brain as the processor: a human conduit synced with relay augmentation.
*   **Project Virtuoso (Elara):** Proof that a tuned human + a focus can do what Dominion hardware alone cannot.

#### Source Foci (Elara-Era Prototypes)
Dominion built “foci” that are inert in normal hands and catastrophic in a conduit’s.
*   **Prism-Saber (Melee):** A hilt that projects a blade of hardened phase-noise—destabilizes bonds instead of cutting by edge.
*   **Caster Gauntlets (Ranged):** Amplify Source signal into shaped Source discharge (concussive / heat / EMP variants).
*   **Vector Harness (Utility):** An inertial rig that locks position for short bursts—wall-walk, micro-blinks, and recoil-cancel tricks.

These prototypes can become late-game “legendary gear,” but **not as destiny locks**: Echo-marked users can ignite them, Orion can stabilize them, Zeke can calibrate them, and Gh0st can operate dampened modes.

The Echoes are the difference between *tools* and *root*. Thorne wants root for monopoly. Vale wants root for ideology.

### Vale’s Variant: The Great Silence (A Crusade)
Vale calls it mercy: remove dissonance by removing individuals. A choir can still fracture; the Soloist cannot.

**The Twist:**
Thorne thinks Harmony is controllable because it’s *her* product. Vale thinks Thorne is a coward playing god for profit. Vale makes his move early: a compliance coup in the Foundry (World 4), then full ascension on the Ring (World 5).

# V. Alien Species

### The Aethel (Orion's People)
*   **Origins:** Native to Veyra. They didn't live on planets; they evolved in the Ocean. They aren't "people" in the human sense; they are **currents** that hold their shape.
*   **The Fall:** The Architects tried to bottle them as batteries. To survive, the Aethel fled into physical bodies (creating the first “aliens”) to hide their signal. Being physical was painful—like being frozen.
*   **Ascension (the Chorus):** Over time, many Aethel learned to slip back into the Source without dissolving. They learned to hold their "shape" without a body.
*   **Limitations:** The Chorus can’t simply walk into the Skin. Dominion damping, phase curtains, and the nature of Veyra make direct manifestation unstable. They can only **nudge** through anchored interfaces: Chimes, Echo Relics, and Echo-marked nervous systems.
*   **How they help (without destiny):** They don’t “choose” heroes. They answer what’s *loud enough to hear*—a reactivated Chime, a Relic handshake, a person risking themselves for someone else. Their influence is wind-on-water: direction, not control.
*   **Orion:** He is one of the last “Physical Aethel.” After stasis, he thinks the music went silent and that his people left him. Near the end, he learns the truth: they aren't dead. They're just underwater. They’ve been screaming his name for 20 years, but he was too "solid" to hear it.

# VI. Glossary & Terminology

### Starborn
Derogatory slang used by the Dominion for things that "fell from the sky" (Aliens/Unauthorized breaches).
*   **Usage:** A slur for Orion or anything Aethel-related.
*   **Reclamation:** To the party, it is reclaimed to mean a "Constellation" (a stable group of stars). They are not one hero; they are a system.

### Aethel Ascension
The process by which an Aethel consciousness sheds its physical form ("melting the ice") and returns to the Source ("the Ocean") as a coherent, self-sustaining pattern. Unlike death, where the pattern dissolves, Ascension allows the individual to join the Chorus while retaining their essence.

### Relics as Anchors
Relics are not merely tools for manipulating reality; they act as heavy "sinkers" or anchors that bridge the gap between the Source (Ocean) and the Physical World (Skin). Without an anchor, Source energy dissipates or burns uncontrollably in the physical realm. The Relics stabilize the flow, allowing specific aspects of reality to be tuned safely.
