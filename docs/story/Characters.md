# Starborn — Main Characters

## Nova

**Role:** Protagonist / The Catalyst (Accelerates Team Tempo - Cooldown Reduction)
**Archetype:** Striker (High-Speed Ranged)
**Weapon:** Dual Laser Guns
**Key Relics:** **The Tuning Fork** (Mines) & **The Anchor** (Void)

Nova is a scrappy colony kid with a rogue vibe—steals, hacks, survives. She’s funny, sharp, reckless in a controlled way, and refuses to let Dominion define her life. Story-wise, she’s the "small person vs huge system" lens. When she becomes **imprinted** by the Source, she acts as the **Living Router**—absorbing raw energy and channeling it to her crew because the pressure is too high for one person.

**Narrative Arc:**
- World 1: Survives first contact (Tuning Fork), loses Jed, chooses freedom.
- World 2: Learns she is a conduit, not a god. "Anchor first."
- World 3: Leads the Lens heist.
- World 6: Rejects "perfect control" (The Anchor) and wins by letting go.
