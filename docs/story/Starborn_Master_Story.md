# I. High-Level Premise

Starborn follows **Nova**, a scavenger in a Dominion mining colony, who uncovers an ancient Echo Relic that leaves her **Echo-marked**—able to interact with **the Source**, the psionic frequency of the universe. The Dominion Corporation, led by **Director Mara Thorne**, is mining the planet not for ore, but to excavate these artifacts and turn the Source into a monopoly: patents, lock-ins, and a labor world that never stops paying.

Thorne sells the project as “Harmony,” but her motive is ownership: margin, leverage, and a Director’s seat that never has to answer to a board. The Dominion already builds Source-harnessing tech (Spectral ID locks, relay augmentation, phase-curtain corridor control); the Echoes are the capstone that turns a portfolio into root access.

Her fixer, **Lieutenant Arden Vale**, is worse—not greedy, but convinced: a radical idealist who believes the only way to end suffering is to erase the fracture of self.

Nova must assemble a crew of broken outcasts, travel across distinct biomes (Worlds), and stop **Ascension**—Vale’s Soloist reboot of the Great Silence: a reality rewrite that erases personhood.

# II. The Arc: Six Worlds + Crash Interlude (Revised Flow)

The journey drops into survival before returning to the City, allowing the party to form before the heist.

| Sequence | Chapter | Biome/Theme | Key Character | Major Plot Beat | Villain |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **The Mines** | Industrial / Underground | **Nova & Zeke** | **Origins.** Nova finds the Relic. Jed hands her a **Chime** (Ghost Signal Cell). Zeke defects and helps her escape in a stolen **Ore Pod**. | **The Warden** |
| **Interlude** | **The Crash** | The Skies | **Party** | **The Pull.** Zeke splices the Chime into the pod for a burst of harmonic thrust. The nav locks to Orion's signal, the Shield hits them, and they crash in Sector 9. | N/A |
| **2** | **The Wilds** | Jungle / Ancient Ruins | **Orion & Gh0st** | **Survival.** The Chime unlocks Orion's Sanctuary. The party discovers a derelict survey ship, **The Astra**. They repair it just enough to fly atmospherically to World 3 ("Limping"). | **Source Beast** |
| **3** | **The Spire** | Neon City / Corporate | **Full Party** | **The Return.** The party steals the **Lens Relic**. The Astra is fully repaired and upgraded here, unlocking the full Hub. Ocean's Eleven style heist. | **The Administrator** |

# III. Detailed World Outlines

## PROLOGUE: THE SIGNAL (Cold Open)
*   **Setting:** Aethel–Dominion Joint Facility, Sector 9.
*   Clean lab lighting. Fresh steel bolted onto ancient stone. Dominion warning stripes over Architect geometry.
*   Dominion consoles spit graphs and warnings: the Source is spiking.
*   Red strobes. A siren that sounds like it’s chewing through the air.
*   **Lab PA:** "SOURCE BEAST CONTAINMENT BREACH."
*   The far doors bow inward like something is leaning on them from the other side—geometry warping, too big for the room.
*   Orion rips a **Chime** (Ghost Signal Cell) from its cradle: a harmonic resonator keyed to his signature.
*   Orion’s voice is a hiss meant for machines and prayers. "Get the signal out. If Veyra can hear me, it can find me."
*   He slams the Chime into the launch tube and hits the release. It rockets away into darkness.
*   For a single impossible beat, the Chorus answers—not a voice, but a soft chord like many notes agreeing to carry it.
*   Orion dives into stasis. "Mute my signal. Now."
*   The glass seals. A shadow lunges at the pod—then cut to black.

## World 1: The Mines (Stellarium Colony 4)
*   **The Status Quo:** Nova is an indentured "Asset" (Scavenger) in debt to the Dominion. She is desperate to meet her quota.
*   **The Hook (The Hustle):** Nova **jury-rigs her mining cutter** to bypass safety limiters and mine faster. It causes a power surge that blows a sector breaker.
*   **The Punishment:** Foreman Bogs catches her. As punishment, he sends her to **Sector 4** (The Dead End) to "clear the magnetic interference" that has been messing with the sensors. "You like high voltage? Go fix that."
*   **The Twist (Zeke):** The power surge flags Nova as **"Asset Liability: High."** The system calculates she costs more to insure than she produces and orders her **"Recycled."** Zeke intercepts the order and deletes it because he admires her grit (or just hates the waste).
*   **The Discovery:** In Sector 4, Nova finds the source of the "interference": The Tuning Fork. She tries to clear it, touches it, and **syncs**. The Relic trips the colony alarms.
*   **The Climax:** Nova flees to Jed. They hijack a cargo pod, but it has no fuel core. Jed hands her a **"Ghost Signal Cell"** (Chime) he's been hoarding—a strange battery that never dies. He stays behind to seal the blast doors, sacrificing himself so she can launch.
*   **The Cost:** Nova’s first uncontrolled Source flare leaves her shaky and hungry—and pings Dominion sensors hard enough to trigger the purge response.

## Interlude: The Crash
*   **The Hook:** The pod clears the rail with the Chime spliced into its core.
*   **The Twist:** The nav hard-locks onto a signal in Sector 9. Zeke can't override it.
*   **The Explanation:** They hit the Planetary Shield outside an authorized corridor. The escape becomes a physics problem, not a fight.
*   **The Climax:** The Planetary Shield flares. The pod slams into the upper canopy and spirals into the Wilds.

## World 2: The Wilds (Sector 9)
*   **The Hook:** Nova and Zeke crash. They are lost.
*   **Recruiting Orion:** The Chime provides limited, local harmonic power to the Sanctuary—enough to release Orion from stasis. He recognizes it as the beacon he launched **twenty years ago**.
*   **Finding The Astra:** The party discovers a crashed Dominion survey ship (The Astra) nearby. It is a wreck, but salvageable.
*   **Recruiting Gh0st:** Gh0st has the party in his sights. He attempts to fire, but his sensors trip a **Harmonic Lock**—a lethal lockout keyed to Elara’s relay-harmonic. He tries to switch targets to Zeke, then Orion, but the Lock spreads like a virus. He can’t shoot *anyone* and doesn’t understand why, so he offers a truce for answers.
*   **The Climax:** Using parts from the Sanctuary and the Chime, they get *The Astra* running. **They attempt to fly to orbit immediately.**
*   **The Pivot (The Ceiling):** They hit the Planetary Shield. It's not just a wall; it's a zapper. The ship takes critical damage. Zeke realizes the Shield has a rotating gap, but they can't see it.
*   **The Cost:** Nova learns fast that Source power isn’t free—Link and Blast burn her out on fumes until Orion forces “eat, rest, practice” into the plan.
*   **The Training:** Orion drills a simple ritual—anchor first, then channel—so Nova can survive the feedback without losing herself.
*   **Breathers:** A mandatory **Canopy Ridge** overlook (open sky + Shield vista) and an optional **Tideglass Beach** rest node (food, banter, and a rare moment of calm).

## World 3: The Spire (Sector 0 - The Surface)
*   **The Motivation:** *The Astra* is capable of **Atmospheric Flight (Low Altitude)**, allowing travel between sectors, but the **Dominion Planetary Shield** prevents off-world travel. They are effectively trapped under a "Hard Deck." They aren't going to the Spire to be heroes; they are going because the **Lens Relic** is the only way to see the safe corridor and leave the planet alive.
*   **The Solution:** The **Lens Relic** (held by the Administrator) grants "True Sight" (Scan). It can reveal the rotating frequency gap in the Shield.
*   **The Heist:** Infiltrate the Penthouse to steal the Lens.
*   **Breathers:** A Lower City **Night Market** detour (optional) and an Upper City **Skypark** (mandatory) to show Dominion’s “utopia” as a costume.
*   **The Climax (The Audit):** Thorne anticipates the theft, but she is interrupted by a holographic appearance from **Arden Vale**. Vale dismisses the party as "inefficient noise" and undermines Thorne's authority, establishing his dominance. Thorne responds by venting the room, forcing a desperate escape. Nova has to use the Lens's "True Sight" to find a dangerous exit (blowing out a window) to reach the ship. Thorne is merely evaded, and the power struggle between her and Vale is exposed.
*   **The Cost:** The Lens tags Nova as an anomaly the moment she touches it—alarms rise early, and the crew has to improvise instead of cruising on a perfect plan.

## World 4: The Foundry (Geo-Thermal Plant)
*   **The Goal:** The *Astra* needs a **Deep-Core Engine** to reach the Orbital Ring (breach velocity) and **Phase-Cutter Weapons** to survive the ascent.
*   **Gh0st's Arc:** This is his birthplace. He confronts the trauma of being a weapon.
*   **The Quiet (Cooling Springs):** Gh0st explains ELARA PROTOCOL to Nova and gives her his override key—trust built through action, not fate.
*   **The Sabotage:** Stealing the Deep-Core Engine physically destabilizes the Foundry. This isn't just scavenging; it's an act of destruction that halts the production of the Ascension Cradle.
*   **The Cost:** Nova’s first attempt to use the Anvil misfires—mastery is earned, and the Foundry punishes hesitation.
*   **Stinger:** After Gh0st’s victory, **Lt. Arden Vale** executes a compliance coup, terminates assets, and relieves Director **Mara Thorne**—arming the **Soloist** variant of Project Harmony.

## World 5: The Void (Dominion Orbital Ring)
*   **The Hook:** Boarding the Ring under Vale’s new regime—clean, quiet, and actively hunting the crew.
*   **Breather (Solarium Deck):** A false paradise route—plants, warm light, a “beach”—before the station drops back into steel and terror. **(Note: This area is locked out after World 5 begins).**
*   **The Goal:** Reach Elara and steal **The Anchor Relic** to stabilize reality, then stop Vale before he completes the Great Silence.
*   **The Reveal:** The crew finds **Thorne hiding in the server farm**, proving her "Harmony" was a product-cage. Vale is the true believer turning it into "mercy."
*   **The Climax:** Vale executes Thorne (already deposed) and becomes **The Ascended**, tearing open the Tear. Elara’s signal is pulled into it.
*   **The Cost:** Nova learns the hard way that new powers don’t mean new status—Stasis can slow machines, not an Ascended mind.

## World 6: The Source (Event Horizon)
*   **The Hook:** The party falls into the raw data stream of existence.
*   **The Goal:** Rescue the party from their nightmare loops, then confront **The Ascended** (Vale) at the center of the signal.
*   **The Surrealism:** The Source isn't random; it is composed of **distorted assets** from previous worlds. Zeke's nightmare is an infinite cubicle maze paved with World 1 Mine Access Badges. Gh0st's nightmare is a forest made of rifle barrels.
*   **The Climax:** Nova uses the six Echoes to "Tune the World" and chooses painful freedom over perfect control.
*   **The Cost:** Tuning the world costs Nova her connection to the Source—and pieces of herself she can’t get back.
