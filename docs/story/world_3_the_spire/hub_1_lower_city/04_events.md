# Events — World 3, Hub 1: Lower City

## EVT_W3_01: The Meeting
*   **Trigger:** Entering Zeke's Apartment (MQ_12).
*   **Action:**
    *   Nova slips in, weapon drawn.
    *   Zeke is mid-pack, startled.
    *   **Zeke:** "You actually made it out."
    *   **Nova:** "You wiped my file. I figured you owed me a couch."
    *   **Zeke:** "Welcome to the last safe place I had. Past tense."

## EVT_W3_01A: Night Market (Optional Breather)
*   **Trigger:** Visiting Night Market Alley (SQ_13, optional).
*   **Action:**
    *   The alley is packed shoulder-to-shoulder. Lanterns swing on frayed wires. Someone is playing a busted synth that still manages to sound like hope.
    *   A skewer stall hisses and pops in the rain like it’s fighting back.
    *   **Mika:** "If you’re here to stare, stare somewhere else. If you’re here to eat, pay up."
    *   Zeke opens his mouth—corporate apology voice already loading—then catches himself.
    *   **Zeke:** "We’re here to eat. And… maybe help."
    *   Nova leans in, grinning. "He means ‘maybe help’ like it’s not his love language."
    *   Orion watches the crowd with something like wonder. "So much noise."
    *   **Nova:** "Here, it’s just people."
    *   Gh0st stands a step behind them, helmet down, trying to look like he belongs. He does not.
    *   A kid points. "Why is that guy shaped like a threat?"
    *   **Gh0st:** "Because I am."
    *   Nova elbows him. "Because he’s shy."
    *   Mika shoves a steaming bowl into Nova’s hands. "Eat first. Then we fix my lights before patrol decides joy is illegal tonight."
    *   The crew eats standing up in the rain, shoulder-to-shoulder, like it’s a ritual they didn’t know they needed.

## EVT_W3_02: The Elevator Ride
*   **Trigger:** Completing MQ_13.
*   **Action:**
    *   Nova and Zeke stand in the glass elevator rising out of the smog. Orion’s voice is a calm thread in their comms.
    *   **Visual:** The camera pans up. The grime of the Lower City gives way to the blinding white and gold of the Upper City.
    *   **Zeke:** "Welcome to Heaven. Don't touch anything, it's expensive."
    *   Above the skyline, the sky has a second skin: a faint, shimmering lattice curving over the planet.
    *   A Dominion shuttle punches through it on a timed corridor—ripples bloom and vanish like a silent drum hit.
    *   Nova watches the ripple fade. "That's the Shield."
    *   **Zeke:** "Planetary Containment. Keeps the workforce in and the witnesses out."
    *   **Orion:** "It isn't a wall. It's a phase curtain. Solid most of the time."
    *   **Orion:** "It opens micro-windows—frequency gaps—for authorized traffic. Without clearance, you don't pass through. You become debris."
    *   **Nova:** "So we steal clearance."
    *   **Zeke:** "I can spoof paperwork. I can't spoof physics. The window is moving."
    *   **Orion:** "The Lens can see it. In real time."
