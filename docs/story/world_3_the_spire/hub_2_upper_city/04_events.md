# Events — World 3, Hub 2: Upper City

## EVT_W3_02A: Skypark (Breather)
*   **Trigger:** Entering Skypark during MQ_14.
*   **Visuals/Action:**
    *   The doors slide open and the Upper City pretends it’s a different planet.
    *   A rooftop garden stretches under a glass dome. Sunlight pours in—warm, perfect, *manufactured*.
    *   Executives stroll between trees that have never known dirt. A fountain sings in clean, rehearsed notes.
    *   Nova’s borrowed clothes itch. Gh0st’s disguise is technically correct and spiritually terrifying.
    *   **Zeke (low):** "Act like you belong. Like… aggressively belong."
    *   Orion tilts his face toward the fake sun. "They built a sky."
    *   **Nova:** "Yeah. And they still found a way to put it on a schedule."
    *   A man in velvet robes—a **Museum Curator**—stops in front of Orion. He isn't looking at Orion's face; he's looking at the way light bends around his skin.
    *   **Curator:** "Fascinating refraction. Sector 9 lineage?"
    *   He reaches out to touch Orion’s arm like he’s inspecting a vase. Orion flinches.
    *   The Curator sneers, wiping his hand.
    *   **Curator:** "Ugh. A Starborn stray. Who let this thing off the leash?"
    *   He turns to Nova. "Control your pet, or I'll call animal control. The city is for citizens, not falling debris."
    *   **Zeke (stepping in, terrifyingly polite):** "Sir, this is a commemorative statue. Very lifelike. Move along."
    *   Zeke hustles them away before Gh0st can remove the Curator's head.
    *   **Nova:** "Starborn?"
    *   **Orion:** "A Dominion word. It means 'trash from the sky'."
    *   For a few seconds, the crew stands under the fake sun, reminded they don't belong.

## EVT_W3_03: The Lens
*   **Trigger:** Solving the Light Puzzle in the Archive.
*   **Action:**
    *   Zeke steps up to the primary console. It's the same model he used to slave over in the mines.
    *   **Zeke:** "Standard Dominion encryption. They think nobody smart enough to break it would ever want to leave."
    *   He cracks his knuckles. This isn't just hacking; it's an exorcism.
    *   **Zeke:** "You deleted my employee ID? Fine. I'm deleting your admin privileges."
    *   He slams the final command key. The containment field drops.
    *   **Zeke:** "Resignation accepted."
    *   Nova steps up to the Lens. It hums, reacting to her presence before she even touches it.
    *   **Zeke (Checking readings):** "Wait. The energy density is spiking. It's reading you as... incompatible. If you touch that, the feedback loop will light us up like a flare."
    *   **Orion:** "He is right. The Source is too loud. We need to dampen it first."
    *   **Nova:** "We don't have time for a safe mode. I can tune it out. I'm strong enough."
    *   **Orion:** "Nova, don't—"
    *   She ignores them and grabs the Lens.
    *   Her vision shifts (Filter change). She doesn't see data; she sees **standing waves**.
    *   Through the ceiling and the skyline, she can suddenly see the Planetary Shield as a rotating lattice—micro-windows opening and closing like a rhythm.
    *   The Lens reveals the structure in two layers: Dominion text on top, **visualized chords** underneath.
    *   **Overlay:** **PHASE CURTAIN // CORRIDOR ROTATION**  
    *   **Undercurrent (faint):** **SYNC: ESTABLISHED**
    *   She sees the Administrator's "Shadow" — a dark tether leading into the Source.
    *   For a moment, she sees her own signature: a messy human waveform... and a thin, old Source thread running through it.
    *   The Lens flares hot. The Archive security system tags her in clean, clinical text: **ANOMALY DETECTED.**
    *   Nova recoils as feedback rips behind her eyes. Orion catches her wrist. "I told you. The Source isn't a toy."
    *   Orion clocks her reaction. "That Source—" He stops as alarms begin to rise. "Later."
*   **Effect:** Unlocks "Scan" (See invisible objects/weaknesses).

## EVT_W3_04: Compliance Override
*   **Trigger:** The Archive alarm (immediately after EVT_W3_03).
*   **Action:**
    *   The Archive lights flip to red. The Administrator’s soothing voice starts to fill the room—
    *   —then cuts out mid-syllable.
    *   **PA (Clean, Polite):** "ORBITAL COMPLIANCE. Lieutenant Arden Vale."
    *   The Lens UI overlays a second tag on the air itself: **CONTAINMENT CORRIDORS: CLOSED.**
    *   **Vale (PA):** "Anomaly detected in the Archive. Administrator, lock the district. I want no ungoverned noise leaving Sector 0."
    *   **Administrator (PA):** "Acknowledged. Happiness is mandatory—"
    *   **Vale (PA):** "Save it."
    *   Zeke goes pale. "That’s not city security."
    *   Orion’s voice drops. "Orbital Compliance. He answers to the Ring."
    *   Nova tightens her grip on the Lens. "Good. Then he can hear me steal it."

## EVT_W3_05: The Breakout
*   **Trigger:** Beating the Administrator and reaching the landing pad.
*   **Action:**
    *   Zeke uses the Lens to spot the rotating frequency gap.
    *   Orion calls the timing.
    *   *The Astra* lifts off; the Shield ripples as they slip through.
    *   The engines sputter in thin orbit.
    *   **Orion:** "We can reach low orbit, not the Ring."
    *   **Nova:** "So we get a bigger engine."
    *   They drop back through the gap and set course for the Foundry.

## EVT_W3_06: The Audit (Thorne's Trap)
*   **Trigger:** Grabbing the Lens.
*   **Action:**
    *   Doors do not open. **Director Mara Thorne** appears on the main screen. She usually looks bored, but today her posture is rigid.
    *   **Thorne:** "You just tripped a station-wide audit. Do you have any idea what you've done?"
    *   **Nova:** "We took what we needed."
    *   **Thorne:** "You didn't take an asset. You summoned *him*."
    *   A second, sharper holographic projection flickers to life beside Thorne: **Lieutenant Arden Vale**. He doesn't look angry; he looks clinical.
    *   **Vale:** "Director. Your containment metrics are… inefficient. I am seeing noise where there should be silence."
    *   Thorne flinches. Visibly. "Lieutenant, the situation is under control. A minor rebellion in the lower sectors—"
    *   **Vale:** "Rebellion is a symptom of individuality. Individuality is a structural flaw. I am scheduling a full compliance review for your sector, Mara. Do not disappoint me."
    *   Vale’s hologram vanishes. Thorne is left staring at the empty space, breathing hard. She turns back to Nova, eyes wide with genuine fear.
    *   **Thorne:** "He's coming. And he doesn't leave survivors."
    *   **Thorne:** "I can't let him find you here. If he sees you, he sees my failure."
    *   **Action:** Thorne vents the room (Oxygen loss)—not out of arrogance, but panic. "Goodbye, Nova. You're a loose end I'm cutting off."
    *   **Result:** They escape, but the message is clear: Thorne isn't the predator anymore. She's the prey.
