# Events — World 6: The Source

## EVT_W6_01: Event Horizon
*   **Trigger:** Entering World 6 (start MQ_25).
*   **Action:**
    *   The party falls through the Tear—then the concept of “falling” stops applying.
    *   Sound becomes geometry. Memories become rooms. Colors have weight.
    *   Nova reaches for the others and only grabs static.
    *   **The Ascended (distant, everywhere):** "Welcome home, Receiver."
    *   The group is torn apart into separate vectors—three nightmares snapping shut like doors.

## EVT_W6_02: Zeke’s Nightmare (Infinite Cubicle)
*   **Trigger:** Entering Zeke’s loop (MQ_25-1).
*   **Action:**
    *   Zeke sits at a desk that stretches into infinity. The same email repeats. The same meeting repeats. The same smile repeats.
    *   A towering figure made of staplers and tie clips leans over his cubicle wall: **THE MANAGER.**
    *   **Manager:** "Your performance is below expected. Please optimize your empathy."
    *   Zeke tries to laugh it off. The sound comes out as a corporate jingle.
    *   Nova appears on the other side of a glass divider—close enough to see, too far to touch.
    *   **Nova:** "Zeke. Look at me."
    *   He can’t. Every time he turns, the loop resets.
    *   Orion’s voice threads through the fluorescent hum: "Anchor."
    *   Nova plants her feet, names three sensations, and forces the loop to stop stuttering long enough to speak.
    *   **Nova:** "You don’t have to be useful to deserve a family."
    *   Zeke’s smile finally breaks. "I kept telling myself I was just… surviving the system."
    *   He looks up at the Manager. For the first time, he says it without joking.
    *   **Zeke:** "I quit."
    *   The cubicle walls shatter into paper snow. The Manager dissolves into a checklist that burns itself to ash.
    *   Zeke stumbles forward into Nova’s arms like gravity remembered them.

## EVT_W6_03: Gh0st’s Nightmare (Endless War)
*   **Trigger:** Entering Gh0st’s loop (MQ_25-2).
*   **Action:**
    *   Gunfire without guns. Orders without mouths. A corridor that never ends.
    *   Targets step out. Gh0st fires. Targets step out. Gh0st fires.
    *   The kill-suite overlays every face with a Spectral ID and a percentage.
    *   **HUD:** "LETHAL FORCE AUTHORIZED."
    *   Gh0st’s hands shake, but the loop moves him like a puppet.
    *   Nova freezes the corridor with Stasis—just long enough for Gh0st to hear his own breathing.
    *   In the frozen silence, a voice cuts through—cleaner than it was on the Ring.
    *   **Elara (echo):** "I wrote a lock. I didn’t write you."
    *   Gh0st’s visor cracks with a hairline of light.
    *   **Gh0st:** "I couldn't save you."
    *   **Elara (echo):** "Then stop trying to earn your right to exist by bleeding."
    *   Gh0st drops the rifle. The loop fights him—his arms twitch, trying to obey.
    *   He pulls Nova’s override key from his pocket and crushes it in his fist.
    *   **Gh0st:** "No more orders."
    *   The corpses around him dissolve into dust. The corridor becomes a quiet hallway. A door appears.

## EVT_W6_04: Orion’s Nightmare (The Silent Shore)
*   **Trigger:** Entering Orion’s loop (MQ_25-3).
*   **Action:**
    *   Orion stands on the shore of a vast, dark ocean. The water is perfectly still. No waves. No sound.
    *   He calls out in Aethel tones; the sound dies instantly, swallowed by the water.
    *   **Orion:** "I should have stayed asleep. It’s empty. They’re all gone."
    *   Nova steps into frame, exhausted but steady. She sits beside him on the sand.
    *   **Nova:** "It’s not empty, Orion. You’re just deaf."
    *   Zeke offers Orion his hand. Gh0st stands guard at his back.
    *   Orion looks at the water. He realizes he has been acting like an island—solid, frozen, separate.
    *   To reach them, he has to stop being a "person" and dip his hand in the water.
    *   He kneels. He hums one note. Not a command—a question.
    *   The ocean ripples. A second note answers from the deep.
    *   Then a third. Then a roar of harmonies rising from the seabed—threads of light braiding through the dark water.
    *   Orion’s breath catches. He realizes they’ve been screaming his name for 20 years, but he was too "solid" to hear it.
    *   **The Chorus (through the water):** *We are here.*
    *   **The Chorus:** *You were frozen. Now you flow.*
    *   Orion laughs, broken and relieved. He isn't the last survivor. He's just the first one to come back to the beach.
    *   **Orion:** "They aren't dead. They're just swimming."
    *   He takes Nova’s hand. "And I have to stay on the shore a little longer."

## EVT_W6_05: The Key
*   **Trigger:** Reassembling the party (end MQ_25).
*   **Action:**
    *   The crew returns to a floating island built from scraps of every world: mine plating, jungle stone, Spire glass, Foundry slag, Ring metal—stitched together by the Source like a collage.
    *   In the center, something waits: a Relic that doesn’t feel like a weapon.
    *   The Key manifests as a simple, impossibly old object—part instrument, part access token—humming with admin authority.
    *   Orion’s face tightens. "That’s not a prize. That’s root access."
    *   Nova reaches toward it and the universe flinches like it recognizes her hand.
    *   **The Ascended (everywhere):** "There it is."

## EVT_W6_06: The Campfire
*   **Trigger:** Before the final climb (MQ_26).
*   **Action:**
    *   The party sits around a holographic fire that flickers between orange flame and waveform light.
    *   **Zeke:** "If we die… I'm still counting this as quitting with two weeks’ notice."
    *   Nova laughs, and it comes out ragged.
    *   **Gh0st:** "He took her."
    *   Orion looks at the void like he can read it. "He can't keep her. Not really. Nothing is kept here. Only… carried."
    *   Gh0st’s jaw clenches. He nods once—acceptance, not peace.
    *   **Nova:** "Vale thinks being alone will stop pain."
    *   **Zeke:** "Being alone is pain."
    *   Nova stares at her hands. The Echo marks pulse faintly.
    *   **Nova:** "When I tune the world… I don't know what it'll take."
    *   Orion speaks softly. "Whatever it takes, you won't pay it by yourself."
    *   Gh0st sets a hand on the ground—an awkward, deliberate gesture of solidarity.
    *   **Gh0st:** "Point me."
    *   **Nova:** "Okay. Then we go together."

## EVT_W6_07: The Temptation
*   **Trigger:** Mid-climb (MQ_26), first major vista.
*   **Action:**
    *   The path becomes a staircase made of memories: Jed’s workshop door, the Wilds canopy, the Spire elevator glass, Foundry heat shimmer.
    *   Vale appears ahead—still wearing his human shape, still polite, like the universe is customer service and he owns the phone line.
    *   **Vale:** "You understand now. This is what you've been doing every time you channel. Editing."
    *   He gestures. The air reshapes into a perfect version of the Mines—no sirens, no hunger, Jed alive at the table.
    *   Nova’s throat closes.
    *   **Vale:** "Take the Key. Fix it. No grief. No loss. No noise."
    *   Nova’s fingers twitch toward the image.
    *   Zeke steps in front of her. "He’s selling you a cage with nicer lighting."
    *   Orion: "A world without pain is a world without choice."
    *   Gh0st: "A world without choice is a weapon."
    *   Nova inhales. Anchors. Lets the perfect image fade.
    *   **Nova:** "Jed didn't die so I could live in a lie."
    *   Vale’s smile doesn’t change, but something behind it sharpens.
    *   **Vale:** "Then you can watch everyone you love suffer… on principle."

## EVT_W6_08: The Final Note (Confrontation)
*   **Trigger:** Reaching the Singularity (start MQ_27).
*   **Action:**
    *   The arena is a single platform floating on the surface of the white ocean.
    *   Vale steps onto the platform. He looks peaceful.
    *   **Vale:** "Thorne wanted to bottle the ocean. Sell it by the cup."
    *   **Vale:** "I want to break the glass. The Aethel exist as pure harmony—a Chorus without pain. No bodies to starve. No minds to break."
    *   He gestures to the infinite white water.
    *   **Vale:** "I will melt the ice, Nova. Everyone becomes part of the current. No one is ever alone again."
    *   Orion steps forward, horrified. "They aren't Aethel, Vale. If you force them into the water, they don't become a Chorus. They just dissolve."
    *   **Vale:** "It is a risk I am willing to make them take."
    *   Nova raises the Key. "You're not saving them. You're just building a mass grave."
    *   **Boss Fight Begins:** The Ascended (Phase 1 - Vale).

## EVT_W6_09: The Choice
*   **Trigger:** Defeating The Ascended.
*   **Action:**
    *   The Ascended falls. The universe is still collapsing. The Tear is screaming.
    *   Nova holds the six Echoes. They are humming politely, buffered by the ship's safety protocols.
    *   **Nova:** "The signal is too clean. Vale’s code is still blocking it."
    *   **Orion:** "We cannot amplify it further without the Array."
    *   **Nova:** "Yes we can. I'm the receiver."
    *   She reaches for the safety latches on the Relics.
    *   **Orion:** "Nova, no. You cannot hold the ocean in a cup. It will break you."
    *   **Nova:** "I’m not a cup. I’m a wire."
    *   She looks at them. "And I'm not alone."
    *   **Zeke:** "We doing this? Like the drill?"
    *   **Nova:** "Like the drill. Form the circuit."
    *   **Action:** Nova uncouples the buffer.
    *   Orion grabs her left shoulder. Zeke grabs her right hand. Gh0st steps behind her, bracing her back with his armored frame.
    *   **Nova:** "Open!"
    *   **Visual:** The Source hits them like a freight train of white light.
    *   **The Circuit:**
        *   **Nova (Spark):** Her eyes go solid white. She screams as the energy pours through her.
        *   **Zeke (Ground):** His hands shake violently. Arcs of blue static shoot off his boots, grounding into the platform. "Too hot! It's too hot!"
        *   **Gh0st (Shield):** His armor vents scream, blasting white-hot steam. "THERMAL CRITICAL. HOLDING."
        *   **Orion (Tuner):** He hums a counter-frequency—a deep, resonant chord that forces the chaotic light into a beam.
    *   **Orion:** "No. We are Starborn."
    *   **Result:** They fire the Tuned Note together. The Tear closes. The feedback blast knocks them all unconscious, but the circuit holds. They fall together.

## EVT_W6_10: Epilogue
*   **Visual:**
    *   Morning in the Colony. The sky looks bigger—like a ceiling got lifted.
    *   Zeke's Diner (Community Board): Nova stands in front of a photo pinned to the corkboard. It’s the crew at Tideglass Beach.
    *   She touches her own face in the photo. She knows it’s her, but she doesn't remember the sand. The file is gone.
    *   Zeke slides a plate of real food onto the table.
    *   **Zeke:** "Don't strain a processor, Nova. It was a Tuesday. It smelled like salt. You complained about the humidity."
    *   Gh0st is by the door, fixing a kid's toy. He doesn't look up, but his sensors are tracked on her.
    *   **Gh0st:** "You also threw a canteen at me. Accuracy: 94%."
    *   Orion enters from the street, bringing fresh air with him.
    *   **Orion:** "The hum is gone?"
    *   **Nova:** "Yeah. I can't hear the music anymore."
    *   **Orion:** "Good. Now you can hear the wind."
    *   Nova looks at them—her backup drive. She realizes she didn't lose her life; she just gave up the receipt.
    *   **Nova (smiling):** "Sounds like a good day. Fill me in on the rest?"
    *   **Zeke:** "Pull up a chair. It’s a long story."
    *   **Credits.**
