# Starborn — Writer's Handbook (The Canon Style)

**Status:** LOCKED  
**Role:** The absolute source of truth for all text generation.  
**Core Pillar:** "Blue Collar Cosmic." The universe is dirty, broken, and held together by duct tape—until the Source breaks it apart.

## I. The Golden Rules (Global)

1.  **The "Grunt" Test:** If a tired shift-worker wouldn't think it, don't write it. (Exception: Orion/Source).
2.  **Texture over Philosophy:** Don't describe the "concept" of poverty; describe the taste of recycled air.
3.  **No Lore Dumps:** History belongs in datapads. Room text belongs to the now.
4.  **The Highlight Rule:** Every Room Description must contain 2-4 highlightable nouns (Interactables). Write the sentence around the object you want the player to touch.

    *   *Good:* "The air smells of ozone and stale coffee. A **Workbench** rattles against the wall every time the engine cycles."

    *   *Bad:* "The room is very clean and high-tech."
    *   *Good:* "The **Airlock** hisses open to a floor that looks like frozen milk. It is too clean to walk on. A **Camera** tracks your pulse."

    *   *Bad:* "The magic energy is strong here."
    *   *Good:* "The **Mural** shimmers like a waveform finding a speaker. The light coming from the **Archway** tastes like copper."

## VIII. Example: Putting it Together (The "Golden Sample")

**Room:** The Server Farm (World 5)  
**Context:** Nova enters the freezing cold server room to find Thorne.

**Room Description:**
"The air here is absolute zero. Miles of blue **Server Racks** hang in the void, humming with the data of a billion stolen thoughts. A frosted **Vent** rattles in the corner."

**Interaction (Vent):**
"You kick the grate. It clatters into the darkness. Inside, huddled in the thermal exhaust, is Director Thorne."

**Dialogue (Thorne):**
"You... you're the miner. The anomaly. You weren't supposed to get this far. The projection models said you'd die in Sector 9."

**Dialogue (Zeke):**
"Your projection models didn't account for Nova's stubbornness quotient. It is statistically significant."

**Dialogue (Nova):**
"Less math, Zeke. Thorne, get up. We're breaking you out of your own jail."

**System Popup (Quest Update):**
OBJECTIVE UPDATED: Escort the Asset (Thorne) to the Anchor Chamber. Note: Asset value is depreciating rapidly.
