# Starborn — Dialogue Style Guide

**Goal:** Ensure consistent character voices across all quests and cutscenes.
**Tone:** "Working Class Sci-Fi." Grounded, weary, but hopeful. Humor comes from character friction, not "jokes."

## I. Character Voices

### Nova (The Protagonist)
*   **Keywords:** Scrappy, Direct, Cynical.
*   **Vibe:** A tired shift-worker who just inherited a cosmic problem. She doesn't want to be a hero; she just wants to not die.
*   **Vocabulary:** Uses mining slang ("Slag," "Breach," "Core-deep").
*   **Sentence Structure:** Short, punchy. Action-oriented.
*   **Bad Example:** "I believe we can defeat the Dominion if we work together!" (Too earnest).
*   **Good Example:** "Zeke, if that thing beeps one more time, I'm putting a laser bolt through it. Focus."

### Zeke (The Insider)
*   **Keywords:** Verbose, Euphemistic, Anxious.
*   **Vibe:** A corporate middle-manager trying to survive outside the office. He processes fear by talking.
*   **Vocabulary:** Dominion HR buzzwords ("Optimization," "Compliance," "Asset").
*   **Sentence Structure:** Run-on sentences. Over-explains everything.
*   **Bad Example:** "That looks dangerous! Watch out!" (Too generic).
*   **Good Example:** "According to the safety manual, standing in a magma vent is a Class 4 violation! Can we please re-evaluate our survival parameters?"

### Orion (The Ancient)
*   **Keywords:** Formal, Melancholic, Resonant.
*   **Vibe:** A lost soul from a better time. He speaks about the universe like it's a song.
*   **Vocabulary:** Musical/Signal metaphors ("Harmony," "Silence," "Tuning," "Echo").
*   **Sentence Structure:** Calm, measured. Often answers questions with questions or observations.
*   **Bad Example:** "We need to go to the bridge now." (Too modern).
*   **Good Example:** "The signal is faint here. Like a heartbeat slowing down. We should move before the silence takes us."

### Gh0st (The Weapon)
*   **Keywords:** Literal, Concise, Deadpan.
*   **Vibe:** Robocop meets Drax. He is learning to be human but isn't there yet.
*   **Vocabulary:** Military/Tactical ("Target," "Neutralized," "Inefficient").
*   **Sentence Structure:** No contractions. Statements of fact.
*   **Bad Example:** "I'm coming to help you!" (Too emotional).
*   **Good Example:** "Target acquired. Removing obstacle. Please stand clear of the blast radius."

## II. Sample Scene: "The Broken Coffee Machine"
*Setting: The Astra Common Room. The coffee maker is sparking.*

**Nova:** "Great. Just great. Even the coffee maker is trying to kill us now."

**Zeke:** "Technically, it's not trying to *kill* us. It's experiencing a thermal regulation failure due to improper maintenance cycles. Which, for the record, I noted in the log three days ago."

**Gh0st:** (Staring at the machine) "The device is hostile. I will neutralize it." (Draws blade).

**Nova:** "Gh0st, down! Do not slash the caffeine."

**Orion:** (Gently touching the machine) "It is not hostile. It is... tired. The coil is out of tune. It has been forced to work past its breaking point."

**Zeke:** "It's a *machine*, Orion. It doesn't have feelings. It has a warranty that expired ten years ago."

**Nova:** "Orion, can you fix it? Zeke, stop quoting the manual. Gh0st... just stand there and look menacing."

**Gh0st:** "Understood. I will intimidate the beverage dispenser."

## III. Writing Rules
1.  **No Lore Dumps:** Characters should talk about *immediate problems*, not history lessons. If you need lore, put it in a datapad.
2.  **Conflict:** Every conversation should have a tiny bit of friction. Everyone likes each other, but they *see the world differently*.
3.  **Show, Don't Tell:** Don't have Nova say "I'm angry." Have her threaten to hit something with a wrench.
