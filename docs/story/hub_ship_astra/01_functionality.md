# Functionality — The Astra

## 1. The Relic "Catch-Up" System (Relic Array)
**Location:** The Common Room (Node 2) - displayed on a workbench or side table.
**Object:** The Relic Array (Container for collected Echoes).

### Narrative Logic
Relics are dangerous and misunderstood Aethel artifacts. The Array provides a shielded, grounded environment where crew members can safely physically interact with them. This controlled exposure allows late-joining members to "catch up" and unlock the skills the rest of the team gained in the field.

### Mechanic
1.  Player clicks on the **Relic Array**.
2.  A menu shows all collected Relics.
3.  Selecting a Relic shows which characters have **not yet unlocked** their Source Art for it.
4.  **Action:** "Sync".
5.  **Result:** Short animation. The character touches the Relic and gains the skill.

## 2. Navigation & Travel
**Location:** The Bridge (Node 1).
**Object:** Nav Console.

### Travel Loop
1.  Player selects "Depart [Current World]."
2.  **Space Travel Interlude:** A stylized travel screen appears.
3.  **Banter Event:** A random or scripted conversation plays.
4.  **Arrival:** Player lands at Hub 1 of the destination World.

## 3. Storage (Cargo Bay)
**Location:** Cargo Bay (Node 4).

*   **Bank System:** Allows the player to store items not needed for immediate combat or exploration.
*   **Capacity:** Upgradeable via "Ship Repair" side quests.

## 4. Simulation Deck (War Room)
**Location:** Simulation Deck (Node 5).

*   **Combat Replay:** Access a list of previously defeated enemy groups to test builds or practice mechanics. No XP gain, but allows testing loadouts.
*   **Cinematics:** Re-watch unlocked story cutscenes.

## 5. The "Rest" State
**Location:** Living Quarters (Node 3).

*   Sleeping in the bed fully restores **HP** and **Refills Snack Charges**.
*   This resets any temporary buffs/meals.

## 6. The Phantom Logs (Elara's Echo)
**Location:** The Chime (Bridge/Common Room).
**Object:** The Chime (Ghost Signal Cell).

### Mechanic
*   **Trigger:** AUTOMATIC. Upon departing a World (during the Space Travel Interlude), the Chime activates the ship's PA system.
*   **Visual Interface:** The ambient amber lights flicker to a cool, sterile blue. The main viewscreen ripples.
*   **Content:** Elara’s tactical logs mixed with non-mission audio fragments (e.g., Elara humming a tune Gh0st recognizes, complaining about the coffee, or recording a birthday message).
    *   *Key Log:* A recording of Elara trying to teach a young Gh0st-unit (734) how to tell a joke and failing. "No, 734, the chicken doesn't calculate the road. It just walks."

## 7. Mandatory Campfire Moments
**Location:** The Common Room.
**Trigger:** Between Worlds (during the Space Travel Interlude).

### Narrative Logic
To transition from "allies by circumstance" to "found family," the party must engage in mandatory downtime.

### Late Game Tone Shift (World 5+)
Once the party enters **The Void (World 5)**, the "Campfire" music shifts from acoustic guitar to a low, resonant drone.
