# Locations — The Astra

## Layout Overview
The ship is small enough to navigate quickly but detailed enough to feel like a home. It features 5 key nodes.

### Node 1: The Bridge (Navigation)
*   **Description:** A cramped cockpit with four seats and a wide viewscreen. The dashboard is covered in sticky notes and bobbleheads.
*   **Function:** **Navigation Console**.
    *   **Travel:** Selects the next World. Exiting via this node places the player at Hub 1 of the destination.
*   **Narrative:** The command center.
*   **NPCs:** **Nova** (Pilot seat), **Zeke** (Nav station).

### Node 2: The Common Room (Social)
*   **Description:** The heart of the ship. A central table stained with coffee rings, a kitchenette, and a lounge area.
*   **Function:** **Campfire Mechanic**. Mandatory party banter and bonding moments occur here.
*   **Narrative:** The messy, lived-in heart where the crew eats and talks.
*   **NPCs:** **Orion**, **Gh0st**.

### Node 3: Living Quarters (Characters)
*   **Description:** A hallway with individual bunks/rooms for Nova, Zeke, Orion, and Gh0st.
*   **Function:** **Character Interaction**.
    *   **Visit:** Unlike standard NPCs, crew members can be visited in their specific rooms for unique, evolving dialogue.
    *   **Rest:** Interacting with the beds restores full HP/Snack Charges.
*   **Unlock:** Fully accessible after World 3 repairs.

### Node 4: Cargo Bay (Storage)
*   **Description:** A lower-deck storage area filled with crates and nets.
*   **Function:** **Secondary Inventory**.
    *   **Storage:** Offload items from the active "backpack" to keep for later (crafting mats, collectibles).
*   **Unlock:** May be damaged/locked in World 2.

### Node 5: Simulation Deck (The "War Room")
*   **Description:** A high-tech projection room, contrasting with the rest of the ship's analog feel.
*   **Function:** **Training & Archives**.
    *   **War Room Mode:** Replay previous combat encounters for practice.
    *   **Holodeck Mode:** View unlocked cinematics or "set piece" moments.
*   **Unlock:** Unlocks after World 3 repairs (implies higher tech level).
