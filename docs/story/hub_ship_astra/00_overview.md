# The Astra — Mobile Hub

## Overview
*The Astra* is a repurposed Dominion geological survey vessel found derelict in The Wilds. It serves as the player's mobile base of operations.
**Hub Access:**
*   **Method:** Every Hub Screen (Homestead, Jungle, City) features a distinct image of *The Astra*.
*   **Interaction:** Tapping this image transitions the player directly into the Astra Hub.
*   **Restriction:** If the ship is critical or grounded by story events, the image may be locked.

## Key Themes
*   **Safety:** This is the only place where the party can relax. No combat encounters occur here.
*   **Growth:** This is where the party upgrades gear, manages inventory, and reviews lore.
*   **Family:** The layout is designed to force interaction. Characters don't hide; they share space.

## Visual Style
*   **Interior:** Retro-futuristic. Analog switches, CRT monitors, exposed wiring. It feels warm (amber lighting).
*   **Exterior:** Blocky, industrial, painted a faded orange.

## Progression Function
The ship evolves visually and functionally:
*   **World 2 (The Wilds):** **Found as a wreck.** Repaired just enough to fly ("Limping"). Some nodes (Simulation Deck, Storage) are locked or damaged.
*   **World 3 (The Spire):** **Fully Repaired.** Reaching the city allows full repairs. The Hub fully opens (Sim Deck, Quarters unlocked). "Homey" decorations appear.
*   **World 4 (The Foundry):** Upgraded with the Deep-Core Engine (Blue flame).
