# Starborn — Emotional & Conflict Map

**Purpose:** To track the emotional pacing and conflict tension across the game.
**Goal:** Ensure every gameplay beat serves a narrative purpose.

---

# Act 1: The Spark

## World 1: The Mines (Origins)
*   **The Beat:** Nova wakes up, finds the Relic, and escapes.
*   **Emotional Tone:** **Oppression & Claustrophobia.** The weight of the rock and the corporation pressing down on Nova.
*   **External Conflict:** **Nova vs. The System.** The Warden, the guards, the locked doors.
*   **Internal Conflict:** **Comfort vs. Freedom.** Nova is safe here (she has a bed, a job, Jed), but she feels trapped.
*   **Interpersonal Conflict:** **Nova vs. Jed.** Jed wants to protect her (stay); Nova wants to fly (go).
*   **Cost Beat:** Nova’s first Source flare is uncontrolled—she feels the feedback (erosion/memory-skip) and Dominion sensors light up.
*   **Emotional Climax:** **Grief.** Jed sacrifices himself. The safety net is cut. Nova is truly alone for the first time.
*   **The Drive:** **Survival.** She *cannot* go back.

## Cinematic: The Crash (Transition)
*   **The Beat:** The escape pod's nav locks onto a strange signal, the Planetary Shield hits them, and they crash in the Wilds.
*   **Emotional Tone:** **Panic & Disorientation.** High adrenaline turning into dread.
*   **External Conflict:** **Gravity + Shield.** The ship is falling.
*   **Internal Conflict:** **Zeke's Regret.** He can't override the lock.
*   **The Drive:** **Urgency.** The ground is coming fast.

# Act 2: The Assembly

## World 2: The Wilds (Survival)
*   **The Beat:** Surviving the jungle, finding Orion, recruiting Gh0st.
*   **Emotional Tone:** **Wonder & Terror.** The beauty of the bioluminescence vs. the lethality of the beasts.
*   **Breather Beat:** **Canopy Ridge** (mandatory) gives open-sky relief and a view of the Spire/Shield; **Tideglass Beach** (optional) lets the crew eat, joke, and feel human.
*   **Flashback Beat:** When the Chime provides a burst of Source thrust, Nova catches a Source imprint—Orion launching it during the lab breach twenty years ago.
*   **External Conflict:** **Man vs. Nature.** The Source Beast, the poison, the erosion.
*   **Interpersonal Conflict:** **Trust.**
    *   **Zeke vs. Nova:** Zeke blames her for the crash.
    *   **Gh0st vs. The Party:** He is literally hunting them.
*   **Cost Beat:** Nova tries to use power like a shortcut and nearly collapses—Orion forces the “focus + practice” rule.
*   **Emotional Climax:** **Empathy.** Gh0st is physically locked out of attacking by Elara's Song. He chooses to trust the anomaly rather than fight the lock. The enemy becomes a protector.
*   **The Drive:** **Hope.** They found a ship (*The Astra*). They have a way out.

## World 3: The Spire (The Heist)
*   **The Beat:** Returning to the city to steal the Lens Relic.
*   **Emotional Tone:** **Cool & Tense.** Neon lights, slick disguises, feeling like an impostor in high society.
*   **Breather Beat:** **Night Market** (optional) is loud, colorful resilience; **Skypark** (mandatory) is bright “utopia” that’s secretly a costume.
*   **External Conflict:** **The Underdog vs. The Elite.** Outsmarting the Administrator.
*   **Internal Conflict:** **Nova's Leadership.** She isn't a soldier or a spy; she's a miner. Can she lead this team?
*   **Cost Beat:** The Lens tags Nova as an anomaly—alarms rise early and the plan turns into improvisation.
*   **Emotional Climax:** **Validation.** The Heist succeeds. The team clicks. They aren't just survivors anymore; they are a *crew*.
*   **The Drive:** **Ambition.** They beat the City. Now they need to beat the Sky (Planetary Shield).

# Act 3: The Truth

## World 4: The Foundry (Vengeance)
*   **The Beat:** Infiltrating the factory to upgrade the ship. Gh0st's backstory.
*   **Emotional Tone:** **Rage & Heat.** The environment mirrors Gh0st's internal anger.
*   **Breather Beat:** **Cooling Springs** (mandatory) is quiet steam-and-water relief before the emotional confrontation.
*   **External Conflict:** **Gh0st vs. Rylos.** The Creation vs. The Creator.
*   **Internal Conflict:** **Identity.** Gh0st learns he is a "backup" of Elara. Is he real? Or just code?
*   **Cost Beat:** Nova’s first Construct misfire nearly kills her—mastery is earned, not wished for.
*   **Emotional Climax:** **Autonomy.** Gh0st refuses to execute Rylos—choosing to be a person, not an instrument. "I am not a gun."
*   **Stinger (after Gh0st’s victory):** **Coup.** Vale terminates assets, relieves Thorne, and arms the Soloist variant—making the real big bad explicit without stealing the catharsis.
*   **The Drive:** **Urgency + Loyalty.** They are doing this for Gh0st—and now they have to reach the Ring before Vale completes the Great Silence.

## World 5: The Void (Ascension)
*   **The Beat:** The Orbital Ring under Vale’s regime. Finding Elara. Thorne’s confession/panic. Vale ascends.
*   **Emotional Tone:** **Cold & Sterile.** The vacuum of space. The uncaring nature of the Dominion.
*   **Breather Beat:** **Solarium Deck** (mandatory) is bright comfort-as-product—a moment to breathe before the Great Silence reveal drops.
*   **External Conflict:** **Containment vs. Freedom.** Vale wants a perfect, unified reality with no fracture. The party wants messy personhood.
*   **Internal Conflict:** **The Moral Dilemma.** Thorne’s Harmony is revealed as a product-cage; Vale’s “mercy” is forced unity. Both are tempting in different ways—both are wrong.
*   **Cost Beat:** Nova tests Stasis against **Lt. Vale** and it doesn’t hold—proof the enemy is beyond brute force.
*   **Emotional Climax:** **Horror.** Vale executes Thorne and reveals the true nature of Ascension. Elara is pulled into the Tear.
*   **The Drive:** **Desperation.** The universe is literally breaking apart.

# Act 4: The Resolution

## World 6: The Source (Catharsis)
*   **The Beat:** The psychedelic finale. Confronting the Ascended.
*   **Emotional Tone:** **Surreal & Melancholic.** A dreamscape of memories.
*   **External Conflict:** **Existence vs. Oblivion.** The Ascended wants to delete everything and start over.
*   **Internal Conflict:** **Acceptance.** Each character faces their Shadow (Negative Self) and accepts their flaws.
    *   Zeke accepts he isn't a hero, just a guy trying to help.
    *   Orion learns the Chorus has been reaching for him—his people are “home,” not gone—and he chooses to stay with the living anyway.
    *   Gh0st accepts he has a soul.
    *   Nova accepts that power is not the point; people are.
*   **Cost Beat:** Nova wins by letting go—tuning the world costs her power and a piece of memory.
*   **Emotional Climax:** **Sacrifice/Tune.** Nova gives up her power (the Source) to save the world. She chooses a messy, painful, free reality over a perfect, fake one.
*   **The Resolution:** **Peace.** The war is over. They are alive.

# Conflict Consistency Check
*   **The Spine:** Nova starts trapped (Mines) -> breaks free (Wilds) -> fights back (Spire/Foundry) -> transcends (Source).
*   **The Heart:** A group of lonely broken people (Zeke, Orion, Gh0st) find a family in each other.
