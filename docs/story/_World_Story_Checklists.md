x# Starborn — World Story Checklists

**Purpose:** Keep the story *holistic* by making sure every World (and major interlude) has a clear goal, a meaningful reveal, a character turn, a Relic/key-item use, and a payoff that launches the next chapter.

## Template (Copy/Paste)

**World/Chapter:**  
**One-sentence promise:** (What the player thinks they’re here to *do/feel*.)  

*   **Goal (External):** What does the party want by the end of this World?
*   **Antagonist Pressure:** Who/what actively prevents that goal (and how does it escalate)?
*   **Key Reveal:** What do we learn that recontextualizes the bigger plot?
*   **Character Turn:** Who changes (belief/behavior), and what moment forces it?
*   **Found-Family Beat:** What concrete scene proves the crew is becoming a family (not just allies)?
*   **Relic / Key Item Use:** What artifact is gained/used, what power/utility does it unlock, and what cost/constraint comes with it?
*   **Failure/Cost Beat (Nova):** Where does Nova try to force an outcome and fail—and what does it cost her (time, safety, memory, trust)?
*   **Payoff (Emotional):** What feeling do we want the player to leave with?
*   **Payoff (Mechanical):** What new capability/system is now live for the player?
*   **Exit Logic / Hook:** What *problem* is solved, what *new problem* is created, and why must the party go to the next World?

## Applied Checklists (Canon Flow)

### World 1 — The Mines (Origins)

**One-sentence promise:** Escape an oppressive colony and survive first contact with the cosmic mystery.

*   **Goal (External):** Get mine access, uncover what Dominion is hiding, and escape the colony alive.
*   **Antagonist Pressure:** The Warden and Dominion security respond to the Relic exposure with lockdown, purge orders, and pursuit.
*   **Key Reveal:** Nova survives an Echo Relic handshake (“Sync established”)—a statistical impossibility that flags her as a living interface.
*   **Character Turn:** Zeke chooses defection (truth over safety); Nova chooses freedom (even at the cost of her home); Jed chooses sacrifice (protection over survival).
*   **Found-Family Beat:** Nova and Zeke become partners under fire; Jed’s last act is to equip Nova to live without him.
*   **Relic / Key Item Use:** The **Tuning Fork** grants **Blast**; the **Chime** becomes the practical escape tool and the future beacon that will pull them toward Orion.
*   **Failure/Cost Beat (Nova):** Her first uncontrolled Source flare pings Dominion sensors (lockdown) and leaves her physically burned out—shaking and bleeding, proving the power isn't free.
*   **Payoff (Emotional):** Grief + adrenaline: the safety net is cut and the story becomes irreversible.
*   **Payoff (Mechanical):** First Source ability (**Blast**), first party member (**Zeke**), and “the world is hostile now” pacing shift.
*   **Exit Logic / Hook:** They get out… but the pod nav hard-locks onto an unknown signal and the Shield hits them.

### Interlude — The Crash (Transition)

**One-sentence promise:** The escape goes wrong in a way that forces the party into survival mode.

*   **Goal (External):** Clear the rail and reach open sky.
*   **Antagonist Pressure:** The Planetary Shield and the pod’s locked nav override human control.
*   **Key Reveal:** The Chime isn’t a power cell—it’s a harmonic-resonator beacon, and something out there is answering.
*   **Character Turn:** Zeke realizes he can’t “hack” everything; Nova’s trust in him is tested when he can’t stop the lock.
*   **Found-Family Beat:** In the chaos, they keep each other alive anyway—no more pretending this is a solo problem.
*   **Relic / Key Item Use:** Zeke splices the **Chime** for a burst of harmonic thrust; the same splice hard-locks the nav to Orion’s signal.
*   **Failure/Cost Beat (Nova):** She can’t “hero” the crash—gravity wins, and their first victory is simply surviving together.
*   **Payoff (Emotional):** Panic → dread → determination.
*   **Payoff (Mechanical):** Transitions the party into the World 2 survival/tutorial framing.
*   **Exit Logic / Hook:** Crash into Sector 9: they’re alive, but stranded and hunted.

### World 2 — The Wilds (Survival)

**One-sentence promise:** Survive a beautiful, lethal jungle and assemble the real crew.

*   **Goal (External):** Get out of the Wilds by following the signal and finding a way to leave the surface alive.
*   **Antagonist Pressure:** The Source Beast, environmental hazards, the noise, and Gh0st hunting them under Dominion programming.
*   **Key Reveal:** The Chime is Orion’s jettisoned beacon from a lab breach twenty years ago; the ruins hint at Architect and Aethel history; Nova’s **Echo-marked** state includes a faint harmonic trace (compatibility, not destiny).
*   **Character Turn:** Orion stops hiding (joins the fight); Gh0st breaks mission certainty (chooses truce/protection); Nova shifts from “reacting” to leading.
*   **Found-Family Beat:** The crew saves one another *when it’s inconvenient*—then gets to breathe like a family at **Canopy Ridge** (mandatory) and **Tideglass Beach** (optional).
*   **Relic / Key Item Use:** The **Chime** provides limited, local harmonic power to the Sanctuary—enough to release Orion from stasis, bring up minimal lighting and interfaces, and reinitialize *The Astra*’s **Bridge Relic**, but not sustain the Sanctuary long-term.
*   **Failure/Cost Beat (Nova):** She tries to Link while unshielded and nearly blacks out; Orion forces the lesson: power is practice + fuel, not willpower.
*   **Payoff (Emotional):** Hope: the universe is bigger than Dominion, and the crew isn’t alone anymore.
*   **Payoff (Mechanical):** Party expands (Orion, Gh0st); first support-style Source ability (**Link**).
*   **Exit Logic / Hook:** They escape the Wilds… but the Shield still cages the planet. To leave, they’ll need a way to *see* its gap.

### World 3 — The Spire (Heist)

**One-sentence promise:** Pull a high-stakes heist in the heart of Dominion to steal the tool that can beat the Shield.

*   **Goal (External):** Steal the **Lens Relic** and use it to slip the Planetary Shield.
*   **Antagonist Pressure:** Surveillance, corporate security, and the Administrator as the Spire’s enforcer and gatekeeper.
*   **Key Reveal:** The Lens exposes the “Shadow” tethers of Dominion power—and Nova’s own signal isn’t as simple as she thought.
*   **Character Turn:** Nova becomes a real leader (strategy + responsibility); Zeke confronts his erased life; the crew becomes a unit instead of a temporary alliance.
*   **Found-Family Beat:** “Base of ops” becomes home—reinforced by breather beats (Night Market resilience, Skypark’s fake paradise) that remind the crew what they’re protecting.
*   **Relic / Key Item Use:** The **Lens Relic** grants **Scan**, enabling the crew to time the rotating frequency gap in the Shield.
*   **Failure/Cost Beat (Nova):** Touching the Lens tags her as an anomaly and blows the timeline—alarms rise early and the crew has to improvise under pressure.
*   **Payoff (Emotional):** Validation: they can beat Dominion on its own turf.
*   **Payoff (Mechanical):** Scan/True Sight utility and the “heist” structure proving the party split works.
*   **Exit Logic / Hook:** They reach low orbit… but *not* the Orbital Ring. The next problem is propulsion: they need a Deep-Core Engine (Foundry).

### World 4 — The Foundry (Vengeance)

**One-sentence promise:** Break into Dominion’s forge, steal the upgrade, and watch Gh0st face where he was made.

*   **Goal (External):** Steal a Deep-Core Engine upgrade and the **Anvil** to reach high orbit.
*   **Antagonist Pressure:** Heat, hazards, and Commander Rylos trying to reclaim/reset Gh0st as property.
*   **Key Reveal:** Project Phantom wasn’t “a unit”—it was Elara, copied. The ELARA PROTOCOL isn’t romance or fate; it’s an engineered failsafe keyed to her chordprint. *(Post-climax stinger)* **Vale executes a compliance coup** and relieves Thorne, arming the Soloist variant.
*   **Character Turn:** Gh0st stops seeing himself as a weapon with permission and becomes a person with choice.
*   **Found-Family Beat:** The party treats Gh0st’s pain as *their* mission—anchored by the Cooling Springs breather—then Gh0st returns it by handing Nova his override key.
*   **Relic / Key Item Use:** The **Anvil Relic** grants **Construct** (tactical creation), but it demands intention and stability.
*   **Failure/Cost Beat (Nova):** Her first Construct misfires over a slag river—she nearly dies, and the lesson lands: she has to train, not “push harder.”
*   **Payoff (Emotional):** Heat + catharsis: revenge turns into autonomy.
*   **Payoff (Mechanical):** Construct opens traversal/puzzle options and combat utility; Deep-Core Engine enables the World 5 ascent.
*   **Exit Logic / Hook:** The ship can climb—but Vale now holds the leash. The fight moves to the Orbital Ring before he completes the Great Silence.

### World 5 — The Void (Ascension)

**One-sentence promise:** Infiltrate the Orbital Ring, find Elara, and learn what Dominion has really been building.

*   **Goal (External):** Reach Elara and steal the **Anchor** to stabilize reality, then stop Vale before he completes the Great Silence.
*   **Antagonist Pressure:** Orbital Compliance under Vale: lockdowns, HK-droids, and a station that treats the party as a contaminant.
*   **Key Reveal:** Project Harmony was always a corporate product wearing utopia language (control, monopoly, profit). The Great Silence is the underlying Architect protocol—and **Vale’s Soloist variant** turns it into a crusade disguised as mercy. Thorne’s emergency addendum confirms she’s been locked out.
*   **Character Turn:** Nova rejects “perfect control” even when it offers relief; the crew commits to messy freedom together.
*   **Found-Family Beat:** The Solarium Deck breather shows what Dominion hoards; Gh0st’s reunion isn’t a victory lap—it’s a team-held grief.
*   **Relic / Key Item Use:** The **Anchor Relic** grants **Stasis**, but it’s limited—great on systems, unreliable on minds that have “admin access.”
*   **Failure/Cost Beat (Nova):** She fires Stasis at **Lt. Vale** and it doesn’t stick; the backlash proves she can’t brute-force the future.
*   **Payoff (Emotional):** Horror: Thorne is executed, Vale ascends, and the universe breaks open.
*   **Payoff (Mechanical):** Stasis becomes the party’s control/escape tool for late-game enemies.
*   **Exit Logic / Hook:** The Tear opens; the crew falls into the Source itself.

### World 6 — The Source (Finale)

**One-sentence promise:** Walk through nightmare reflections, choose who you are, and pay the price to keep the world free.

*   **Goal (External):** Reassemble the party, defeat the Ascended, and stop Vale’s rewrite.
*   **Antagonist Pressure:** Reality itself fractures; each character is trapped in personalized loops.
*   **Key Reveal:** “Perfect control” is just tyranny with better lighting; freedom is messy by design—and Orion learns the Chorus in the Source has been reaching for him all along.
*   **Character Turn:** Nova shifts from “survive” to “choose”—she chooses people over power.
*   **Found-Family Beat:** The crew rescues one another from their worst selves; the family is mutual, not centered on Nova alone.
*   **Relic / Key Item Use:** The full set of Echoes enables “Tune the World,” but it burns out the receiver.
*   **Failure/Cost Beat (Nova):** The final note costs her the Source connection and pieces of memory—she wins by letting go.
*   **Payoff (Emotional):** Catharsis: earned peace instead of perfect order.
*   **Payoff (Mechanical):** Finale abilities pay off; the game closes the loop on every Relic.
*   **Exit Logic / Hook:** Epilogue: the family lives, ordinary and free.
